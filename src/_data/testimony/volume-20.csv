My neighbours being good, rural Alberta people figure somebody’s in need, you look after them regardless of how they got there, I guess.

There’s only that road at 501, which is the road that crosses the tracks to get out to you there. That was one of my major concerns, was that we had egress quickly in the event of an emergency.

20-077-16,"It’s cold out there. How long can I talk? No, the situation that happened there, there were a lot of people that said that I was against the protest. And I wanted to make it perfectly clear, I was never against the protest. You have that freedom, that right to protest anytime you want, as long as you don’t break the law and interfere with my right to travel and so on. I mean, I -- in a way, I participated in their protest, because along with the other border mayors, we communicated with the Federal Government saying, “This is not right, to treat these guys, after the two years, as if they’ve suddenly become pariahs or something.” So the biggest problem that I had, and I still have, understanding blocking that highway, was who you thought you were damaging. You were damaging your neighbours. I had stock movers who couldn’t move cattle because it was blocked. That’s a whole part of a chain. People grow their stock, they plan for a particular date to deliver it to the feedlot, so they’ve got feed for X number of days. Now that’s backed up. Now they’ve got to try and find feed. Well, gee, the feed comes from the other side of the border. They didn’t take into consideration the fact that, yes, they made a big splash, but they were hurting the very people that they figured they were helping by getting the mandates off. We’re a very agricultural area. I mentioned that I’m the chair of a regional economic development initiative. Our whole emphasis is on helping to establish that Canada trade corridor and the food corridor with all of the potatoes, and sugar beets, and pulses, and all of those products. That’s our main emphasis. And when you cut -- you stand there with your foot on my throat and say, “You’re not going to go through here anymore,” and what you’re doing is you’re actually choking the livelihood of all your friends and neighbours. And even if they sympathise with you, when they go to the grocery store and there’s no fresh produce there because it’s on the other side of the border, it’s something to consider. So that was the main thing. And when the protest turned to an illegal blockade, they lost my support. And that’s it. And I did what I did as far as the village goes because I’m responsible for those people. And I’ll try and get through without breaking down here this time, but there were people -- it was literally - - people were literally physically frozen and not able to go through that blockade. And since everything is on the other side, it was a tough situation. But we’re not here to argue about that anyway. The feeling that I got, to be truthful, is -- which I have to be, right, is that the federal action had very little to do with the resolution of the blockade there. I think it was the police action, the finding of the undesirable element. I know that happened. I have -- I've talked to neighbours who saw the actual police action that night. It wasn't a carrying in weapons and planning them. It was a raid with SWAT-type vehicles. We had a field hospital set up at the fire hall and that kind of thing. So it was a very serious -- very serious situation. So -- and one last thing. I'm very complimentary of the police. The RCMP handled themselves very well. And I'm glad it's over.

20-113-23,"How it works? And I think the Deputy speaks to it a little bit here. But the way that the CVOR regulation works is it’s a -- it’s a process by which there’s escalating penalties and by which a safety record is built over time that allows the Deputy Registrar to take action. So what I mean by that is based on an operator’s safety record, so based on, you know, the inspections that they have, the convictions that they have, or on road events, so collisions, they accumulate points. And as they accumulate points on their record, the Province takes escalating sanctions towards them. So it starts with warning letters, it might involve an interview to talk to them about their safety practices, and then it would move to perhaps suspensions or other kind of actions to try and redirect them, perhaps a safety audit, up to eventually it could include a cancellation. At the time that we issue a cancellation, or throughout this process, they’re given written notice that this has happened, they’re -- at the time of cancellation, and then they are allowed to seek a hearing or a response in writing to the Deputy Registrar. There’s -- based on that, there’s also an appeals process that they’re allowed to go through as well. So I think that was the challenge that we were trying to communicate to Transport Canada and the City of Ottawa at the time was that the Highway Traffic Act itself and the CVOR is built around this process or these procedures that are well understood by the Courts, well understood by industry, and to protect the legitimacy of it, we couldn’t try and use that process to do something different. And that was the challenge that we were trying to articulate, until the emergency orders were put in place, where it was a different regime.

20-154-09,"No. Okay. So I’ll just get your take on some of these takeaways from the call. It says: “Here are a few key takeaways. They are now [they being MTO, I understand] are now working through regular regulatory processes with respect to the trucks involved in blockades. For example, if there were tickets laid that impact CVOR, they will run the course of conviction and then would be reflected on the record.” (As read) Can you explain what that means?",20-154-11,154,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. JEAN-SIMON SCHOENHOLZ,MR. JEAN-SIMON SCHOENHOLZ,jean-simon schoenholz
20-154-23,"Yeah. So that’s as I was talking about before. So if there’s a conviction that’s related to mechanical fitness or driver behaviour, that is related to the commercial vehicle operator registration.

20-155-05,"No. And then if we just go down a little bit, the third bullet point: “For out-of-province trucks, of which there were many, plates were seized and mailed back to the registrar of the home jurisdiction with an explanation letter. However, there is no mechanism to ensure that there would be an impact on the operator record. MTO is waiting to hear what the response from those provinces and territories will be.” (As read) So my understanding is that that’s still an issue, the ability to enforce CVOR penalties in other provinces and territories?",20-155-07,155,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

20-155-22,"And then lastly, if we go down in terms of lessons learned to the second bullet under that: “At provincial level, what was lacking for MTO was ability to take immediate action on misconduct aside from temporary powers under the provincial Emergencies Act. The system right now only kicks in when there are convictions.” (As read) And that’s consistent with what you’ve told me to date; correct?",20-155-24,155,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And it’s not clear to me based on the -- because this is black and white -- who made the statement, but someone at MTO was under the impression that the total cost for the installation, removal and rental of the jersey barriers would be covered 100 percent by MTO.

I’ll let you know once I hear more.” And he continues: “The Deputy also indicated that he understood but was confirming that costs like the jersey barriers that were authorized by MTO staff at OPP’s request would be paid for by the Province.” Do you see that? So if you can scroll up, Mr. Clerk. And you’ll see an email from Mr. Raynar to the same group the next day, and it states: “It would appear that the new Deputy Minister MTO is finding out just how the Province works. He stepped back from both items today that we discussed earlier in the week. MTO will not be covering the costs of the barriers, although he said he would not be surprised to see an application for the Province to assist with those costs and others(?) at some point. No commitment to pay, though, at this time.

Eaton on some other files and have recently been asked to lead/coordinate MTO’s overall response at the provincial level related to various...” And I’ll slow down here: “...blockades in the province. I am reaching out to you regarding the ongoing blockade at the Windsor-Detroit Bridge.” And I’ll pause here because C/Supt. Pardy was actually in charge in Ottawa, not in Windsor. Mr. Boparai was confused and that get clears up -- that gets cleared up, pardon me, up the chain. He says: “We are wondering whether the OPP has been collecting CVOR information of trucks blocking the bridge crossing and if available, can this information can [sic] be shared with MTO. This will allow us to review and be better prepared to support the OPP as this situation continues to evolve. Would be great if we can discuss this further or if you can connect us with the appropriate OPP contact. Thanks,” And if we scroll up, just so you can get the context, Mr. Freeman, that’s C/Supt. Pardy’s response advising that he’s in Ottawa leading the support plan for the OPS, and advising him who’s in charge in Windsor and giving some additional information.

We just wanted to understand more. And there was even -- you know, we were having all sorts of discussions as to how we could help. I think it’s important to know, we were certainly there to support the OPP but at this time, we had been having discussions with the federal government and others about what else can the Province do. At this time, we were looking at what sort of -- because we believed the CVOR did not work, what could we do? And that’s how the Emergency Order came about. Or I shouldn’t say that’s now the Emergency Order came about; that’s part of what went into the Emergency Order within a matter of two days was new powers that could do what was being asked. So we were looking at all sorts of different angles. We were there to assist the OPP; we weren’t doing any direct enforcement, but we were trying to gather information just like many other people were as well. So we were looking at all sorts of ideas, and I think this also connected, there was just a question; could we start calling CVOR operators to tell them that their truck might be there. Like, this was just, you know, one of the many angles we were trying to do to try and help solve the situation that week. Just because we didn’t think the CVOR was the right way to go, it didn’t mean we weren’t trying to find other ways to address the situation that week.",20-193-18,193,18,16,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

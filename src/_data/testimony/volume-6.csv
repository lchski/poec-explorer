I would say that the bulk of the information for demonstrations prior to the convoy was not Intelligence-based, it was information, and so it was, you know, open source. Whether that is, you know, for an example, if we have a concert coming into town, the Special Events Unit will look at what kind of, you know, music it is, what kind of crowd it draws, they will speak to places where that band has played before, and they will develop a plan that is, you know, commensurate with what they've seen in other places. And so for the convoy, they did their usual where they looked to, you know determine as much as they could, reached out to other police services where the convoy was travelling through, getting information from them, trying to get an assessment or an idea of numbers that we were looking at and what kind of behaviour they were engaging in along the way in their cities. And up until point we were hearing that, you know, they were cooperative, they were providing lanes of traffic across the Prairies.

I think what they did was they developed a plan commensurate to the experience that we’ve had for over two and a half decades in this city, as far as I know, on what demonstrations generally look like, how long they last, and the type of behaviour we see.

I think towards the last few days, we were seeing that there was a big spike in the GoFundMe money being raised, so that was different than most of the demonstrations that we see. Did that tell us specifically that they were planning on staying for a long time and that when they got here, they would engage in the behaviour that they did? It did not. And I think what we’ve learnt is that there’s a lot of misinformation, disinformation and false information surrounding this group, and so they were trying to assess as best they could, but they relied general on the experience that that seasoned planning team had.",06-014-15,14,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And I raise that because with this witness, we have 25 minutes. I know my friends have - - some of them have less, maybe some have more. It's not possible for us in the limited time that we have to put each of the pieces of information that might, for example, put into context the questions my friend Mr. Au has raised so far about the premise of his question, a strong possibility that it was going to be longer. Well, there's evidence that it was going to be a weekend, and we can draw it out, but I would be grateful if I could raise through you that the Commission's time with the witnesses be perhaps more balanced in presenting the information that in this case Deputy Chief Ferguson had at the time rather than counting on her to remember all of it.

But we also had our Public Order teams, our Police Liaison Teams, we had Intelligence Teams, we had Investigations, we had our Communications Team, we had Logistics, Staffing.

06-030-04,"So that’s a group of specially trained officers who, when we have demonstrations, before, during, and after, they’re engaged in reaching out to organizers to build rapport with them, to find out what it is that the group is trying to achieve, to work with them to help facilitate what they are looking to achieve in town. And so, you know, part of that is if a group would like to, you know, have a march down Albert Street at 8:00 o’clock in the morning, we might try and speak with them and saying, “Maybe, how about we did it at 10:00 o’clock? That might be --” so those types of conversations happen. They look to, as I said, build rapport and relationships with the people who are involved so that when they get here, that relationship is already established and they can have conversations with them about what is acceptable behaviour by the people of their group, where, you know, their Charter of Rights end, and perhaps criminal charges could be -- or, you know, disobedience and civil disobedience type of things will occur. And in the event that something is going on during the event, where there might be an agitator or an antagonizer, then they would speak to that person that they already had the relationship with and let them know what the consequences are, or that this behaviour is problematic and we’d like for that cease, insomuch as it really is about negotiating and trying to change behaviours through conversation.",06-030-06,30,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Again, we have about 100 officers, both sworn and civilian, mostly sworn, who are trained in being able to -- whether it’s crowd control, crowd management, those types of things. So they are the ones who ultimately we saw take the streets on that weekend that moved forward with moving people out of the streets.

And so we were monitoring with that lens for sure. And we were starting to see, you know, they were pulling into the areas that they were sent to or steered to. And then we started to see, I would qualify it as a bit of a party atmosphere, sort of festival-like, people were very excited to be there. Myself and Deputy Bell walked around in the downtown core and saw some of the, you know, the people that were there. And it was, in those first few days, not as, I would say, as disruptive as it got to be. When the weekend came and went and Monday morning arrived and they were still on our streets, at that point in time, Ottawa Police was in a situation of, “Okay. We’ve got to pivot. We have to reassess what we’ve got here. We have to evolve our plan.” So began starting to, you know, strategize and brainstorm as to what actions could be taken, what did we have available to us. I know that, you know, at the command level, we had considered an injunction with the City, we had spoken to other police partners. A lot of those things were going on at all levels. So at the strategic, the operational, and the tactical level, I know our members were fully engaged in those types of behaviours, to try and come up with what our next plan -- we knew we needed to evolve and move into another stage, really.

I think we had some expectations that those folks who were in the surrounding areas, would retreat back to their homes.

06-035-02,Sorry; why was staffing the number one risk?,06-035-04,35,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR. FRANK AU,frank au
06-035-04,"The state of the Ottawa Police at this stage was one of very poor staffing. We had been in that state for, I would say, a number of years. Prior to becoming the Deputy of Community Policing, my position was the Superintendent of Frontline, and so it was a challenge every day to make sure that we had all the shifts covered. The pandemic obviously, like any other workforce, had a large impact on our people; we had some high sick levels. At this point in time, we were in the sixth wave of COVID and so what we had done to try and mitigate that was -- and it had been quite successful in the early days of the pandemic, was to establish a reserve staffing. So a group of officers who would be healthy at home, should we have an outbreak where we have an entire platoon taken out, we are able to upstaff. Another measure that we took was to limit our -- we have six platoons, generally; we cut it down to four platoons. So if you think of 30 people per platoon, when we divided one in half, then we had 45 members on each platoon to up our numbers a little bit to try and mitigate that. And that was going into the convoy. We were already -- I would describe us as being on our knees and having run a marathon for the last two and a half years, and it felt like they’d moved the finish line 100 yards, or another mile, and given us 200 pounds to carry to get to the end. So staffing was, I would say, our number one Achilles heel in all of this. And so all of these people who had worked for the week leading up to the convoy, over the weekend -- and long hours; you know, our frontline members were working 12 hour shifts. When the convoy came and we were trying to manage staffing and clear posts, some of them were working up to 15 hours, and it was -- they were -- they were exhausted. So we needed to make sure that our people had time off. And so that, I believe, is what we’re thinking about, is it’s a risk for us to be able to staff all of this.",06-035-06,35,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

So this seems to be about a meeting that he was having with the Command Team at 8:00 a.m., and he set out some priorities. So for example, here, you see three general priorities listed, ""surge, contain and enforce""; the second being, well, ""close everything"", in brackets: ""...(roads, bridges, highway off ramps...) as early and as long as possible."" The third priority being to shut down -- well, shut down a number of things: Shut down the funds, the fundraising; shut down the fuel; shut down the fun, the bouncy castles and so on. So these are the general priorities, and then some specific priorities with respect to locations are set out, and we see four here.

And so this caused, obviously, the Mayor and a number of people concern that this was going on. They were concerned for the safety of having, you know, fuel and those types of things. So our PLT team went in to speak to the people who had set up in there and they engaged them in conversation and started to try and get some movement there. It took several days, and much to the frustration, I think, of former Chief Sloly, as well as a number of city officials, but we were able to -- we brought in an Algonquin Elder, because they had indicated that that was -- that they were from the Algonquin Nation and that they -- you know, this was a means to try and engage in conversation and get to a middle ground we could.

06-059-10,"So I don’t think that the chief -- I know he had some former public order experience, but I don’t think he had used PLT as much as we were, you know, experienced here in Ottawa. We, you know, have had people trained on this for a number of years and it has served us incredibly well in a lot of demonstrations and really taken the temperature down and been able to get us, you know, longer term wins, but wins where people walk away safely, where they feel like they were heard, and that their goal was met. And that is part of it, because we want to make sure that we’re, you know, we’re not creating a situation that they will be coming back again. So our PLT, I knew, had that capacity. I was familiar with the program. I was involved. I was a superintendent when we had a previous demonstration that shut down a major intersection not long before this, and we used the PLT quite successfully in that. but after that event, they came to me and said, “We need more people. We need a little bit more importance placed on this, because it really is an amazing tool.” And so they convinced me and they said they were, you know, would like to get more people trained, and I approved that, and that did happen. And I’m glad we did have a number for this protracted event so we were able to rely on them. It also creates good will with other police services. And so in this case, the OPP stepping in to assist us in this bolstered our numbers that we were definitely needing. And it means that you have to be able to work in an integrated manner. I don’t believe Chief Sloly was familiar with the framework. There is a national framework that has been developed on police response to demonstrations, and this was borne out of a lot of Indigenous -- protracted Indigenous demonstrations. And the OPP, obviously, have had a number of experiences with that. So what they brought to the table was very valuable to our team. And I believe, as you cited Insp. Lucas’ assessment of Chief Sloly, and I think Supt. Patterson as well was on that page, was that we were needing to demonstrate to the community that we were actually -- we were taking actions. And I understand the pressure and stress that they were -- they both felt. I felt it as well. But I also felt that we were going to be judged on this, here we are all these months later, on our coming out of this with as few people hurt as possible, as, you know, much good will as possible, that we haven’t burnt any bridges with our community, with other policing agencies, and with anyone, really. So I felt that taking a longer-term approach and potentially getting a, you know, a bigger win at the end was the way to go. And I, you know, was receiving information that crowds, generally 80 percent of people are law-abiding and they want to follow laws, and if you give them an opportunity to have a win they will often go on their own. And so those were some of the things that I felt we needed to give that a really good try, and I don't believe Chief Sloly, at this stage in it, was feeling the same way about it.",06-059-12,59,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

We had been asking for resources, Chief Sloly had been going to a variety of services, mostly with the RCMP and the OPP, requesting assistance in the way of police resources. And I think what they were trying to -- this group was trying to determine how many people we needed and what was, you know, what was the ultimate goal and what was the plan, and we struggled a little bit with coming up with a plan per se. So like I mentioned earlier, the concept of Operations, that was part of what we were working on there to provide them those services to say, ""This is what we are hoping to do and this is how we would like to do it in broad strokes"", not without, like a full, full plan.

06-065-14,"So if I could take you, Deputy Chief, to the Mission Statement. This is the Strategic Concept of Operation that you've developed, and the Mission Statement says: ""The Ottawa Police Service, in a collaborative approach with other police agencies, federal, provincial and city partners, community organizations and the event organizers will provide a safe and secure environment in the City of Ottawa during the Freedom Convoy 2022 event. The primary goal is to end the protest peacefully. This may be achieved through proactive engagements by all officers including Police Liaison Teams, facilitating communication, de-escalation and negotiation as means to achieve a peaceful resolution."" So there was an inclusion of the engagement process, and specifically, the Police Liaison Team here. With that in mind, I want to take you to... Now -- so we were -- before the break, we were talking about this meeting, initial meeting, with the Integrated Planning Group at 5:35 p.m., right, on February 8th.",06-065-16,65,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

So you see a reference of something the former Chief said. He said, “People came to assess my readiness and if we’re ready to receive their resources.” We go down further. The Chief said, “Enforcement is where we need to be. We need to show teeth and that the officers”.

06-067-07,"So the Chief wanted sort of -- it was a meeting after the meeting to determine what my perception of what was taking place here. And as I was the only one who actually was physically at the location with the other partners, everyone else called in on the phone. I believe I had a scribe with me who took notes for me. So the Chief was -- he was late to join the call for a very good reason, but was unable to hear the initial part of it. And I think he was disappointed that we weren’t able to be on Teams. It was an RCMP facility. So there were a few things about it I think he was frustrated about it, and he wanted to know what my perception of, you know, their position and more of sort of a strategic what do you think they’re looking for from us in order to give us resources.",06-067-09,67,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

06-068-04,"He seemed to be suspicious of what the -- why they were here, you know, why couldn’t they just give us the resources that we were asking for. I think he was feeling tested, and we all were being tested, I think, to a certain degree, where is our plan, what is -- -- you know, what is our goal, what do we -- what’s the impact we’re trying to achieve.

06-069-01,"I was unfamiliar with what Hydra was. I guess it’s a mythological Greek figure. But he spoke about it -- you know, this thing having many heads and so, you know, we needed to, as I wrote here, “cut off and cauterize the heads”. So as we were able to take control of a situation, then we held that position. I think that’s what he was referring to as cauterizing.

So he had called us all in there, I think, in response to the meeting of the night before and my assessment of things that I don’t know that he necessary agreed with or I might not have instilled the confidence that he was hoping to hear, so he set out to -- all of us to meet and then to actually put this plan into some form of a visual documentation which you saw. That was one of our very adept planners who was -- or project manager who was able to come up with that visual that you saw that we shared with them with the -- each of the different points and how we were going to go about affecting those actions.",06-069-19,69,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

06-070-26,"Generally what happens is plans develop and you have versions of them and for everybody’s sake these, when you are sending a plan around for people to see, you put the most recent version of it, so I think that’s what the 3.0. And I think we dropped the “Hydra”. I don’t think that was necessarily a plan name we wanted to go with, so I think this is what replaced that.",06-070-28,70,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

06-071-12,"Okay. Now, if we can go to page 6. I believe that’s where the mission statement is. This is a shorter mission statement compared to the Strategic Concepts of Operations document that you had provided the day before.

And you start with that really focus on negotiation as a starting point. I think my recollection of that meeting was he and I had some arguments, I will say -- we had a discussion, we had a disagreement on that and, ultimately, he said it was understood that we were going to be negotiating and he did not want it to be in the mission statement, so this mission statement is what was put in in the end.",06-071-25,71,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

There was probably five or six of them, and we had a full team ourself. And I suggested that perhaps a better option was to go out to where they were set up. They had come in from out of town. Some of them didn’t know Ottawa, but they were already out at the -- one of the RCMP stations, and that we could go out there and present. There was plenty of room. I had just been there the night before. It was set up. And the chief said something to the effect of, ""This is the strategy. This is a -- you know, I don’t expect you to understand, but this is our house and we're going to do this in our house."" So I felt that was a bit of a power move that I didn’t think was necessarily was necessary in the circumstances, because I really did feel that they were here to help and why are we inconveniencing them? The chief referred to it as, you know, having -- we shouldn't have to drive out to the boonies to go and -- he called it ""Farrhaven"" to go for this meeting. So that was what that conversation was. And then when he talks about last night being amateur hour, that’s what I was alluding to in that we couldn't get the computer set up, we couldn't get Teams going.

I believe they were a group that was originally mostly from Quebec, from the Quebec area -- I’m not sure exactly where -- and they were -- I would say the ones that were, they were antagonistic. Over the course of the convoy, you know, when people were trying to leave, they were the ones, I would say, intimidating people saying, “Hold the line. You’re not going anywhere,” those types of things. And because of the location where they were, that was a major intersection that we were trying to gain back and their presence there certainly contributed to the Rideau Centre being closed, which was obviously one of our major businesses in the city and was suffering as a result, and we were trying to open that intersection up to be able to get -- you know, there’s obviously access to Quebec that comes with that, and the Byward Market.",06-078-14,78,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

06-082-09,"So this meeting -- this was -- you know, as you were showing here, this is a series of discussions that I’m having with both the Event Commander who’s reporting to me and Former Chief Sloly about the approach that I felt we needed to be taking. And as the Major Event Commander, I was trying to drive in that direction and was continually getting pushback, some of it very public and some of it, you know, behind closed doors. And this was a meeting, when we got to this point, Supt. Patterson was also very frustrated and he was, you know, presenting his point to the group. And so there was a comment made during this meeting where he, in my estimation, maligned one of our most seasoned Critical Incident Commanders on a decision that he made not to approve this plan and he chalked it up to him not being involved and not knowing enough and that’s why he didn’t approve it. And so at the end of the call, once we did all the checks that we did on these briefings -- go through communications, through, you know, “What’s the update? How many people on the Hill?” those types of things -- once that was completed, I had asked for a number of people to stay on the call. So, you know, our corporate communication folks would have dropped off, and some of the other players, but the Chief was one, Supt. Patterson was on. I don’t know all of the people who remained on the call but our legal -- Christiane Huneault was on that call as well and I started by saying, “I want to clarify the role of the Incident Commander.” In this case, it was Supt. Burnett who had not approved the plan that Patterson put forward for actions on at Rideau and Sussex, and he had his reasons for it and a lot of them related to safety of our members and it was involving POU teams from other police services who had also expressed their concern about the safety of this action to Supt. Burnett. And so I wanted to clarify that and to say that I didn’t believe that these types of actions were going to -- that they were a good move at this point in time. If we had said we were going to negotiate, which is what we agreed to with the OPP just yesterday when we presented our -- it was yesterday -- when we presented that plan, then that’s what we had to commit to, and I didn’t feel we were doing that and I felt we were doing a disservice to everybody involved, and not to mention, you know, putting pressure on -- and putting our members at risk. They had been swarmed by protestors at this location before. We knew that they had that potential and so this of all of them was probably the most dangerous of all the intersections that we would take on. So I expressed that, and then you probably see conversation back and forth between myself and Superintendent Patterson, and the Chief weighed in. And then at one point in the meeting, Superintendent Patterson asked here, and you see in my notes, if Christiane Huneault, who was our legal -- our lawyer, was on the call, and she said, ""I'm here."" And he said, ""I want this for the notes."" And then he made, you know, I would say an attack on my integrity on behaviour that he felt that I was engaging in that was unethical. And at that point in time, I, you know, indicated that I didn't think -- that no one said anything, so I said, ""I don't -- you know, I think this is going to really be difficult for me to move forward in this position. I feel like I'm a fly in the ointment that's going on right now and that I'm fighting on two fronts, and that I wasn't willing to do that anymore."" So I said to the Chief at that point, ""If you need to remove me in order to be able to go ahead and carry out your plans, you're going to have to do that, but I cannot -- I fundamentally disagree with the way we were going, and that I couldn't put our members at risk in that way.""

My husband at the point was working with the PLT team, and that I was getting, you know, information that I shouldn't have been having at that point was really the accusation. And so I suggested to the Chief that if he really believes in the direction that he is suggesting, then I'm not the person to be the commander of this event. And so he said he would think about it, and at the end of our conversation, he ultimately said, ""I will keep you as the event commander, but you must promise me that you are going to take some days off, that you need a couple of days rest.""",06-084-23,84,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

""Unclear and vague Command and control."" I think we had a system in place, but we had players who were, you know, jumping up or jumping down the -- our Incident Command structure. ""Unqualified trained leadership."" We had lost a lot of our subject matter experts in the four, five years leading up to this. We used to be really, really strong and, you know, our response to -- when I think of what happened here in 2014, the shooting on Parliament Hill, we were subject matter experts and we had leaders in that area, and a lot of that had gone with retirement. And because we hadn't had any big events, you know, with COVID, with a no presidential visits, none of those things, we hadn't flexed those muscles. And so this was obviously unprecedented in terms of its size and the type of thing we were dealing with. So I don't know whether unqualified is fair. I would think that there's some people in that chain who would say that they very much are qualified, but I think from an OPP or somebody looking in maybe would see that.

06-089-25,"Well, I believe at the strategic level. The relationship was strained. And whether that was Chief to Chief or Chief with some of the City partners, some of the, you know, political people who needed to be involved. We did have, I would say, good collaboration. Kim Ayotte and I spoke fairly regularly in terms of, you know, “What are your people seeing and what are you experiencing” How can we support? How can help?” Those types of conversations were going on fairly regularly, but at certain levels we were not seeing that same level of collaboration. “Focused on local issues only.” I believe that statement that Supt. Patterson made was right, and I also recall former Chief Sloly saying, “I’m not -- I don’t care about what’s going on elsewhere. Ottawa is where I need to, you know, have my focus.” And, you know, from his perspective I can understand that. But we did know that when we took actions here it had ripple effects across the country; these were very connected, reactive people. “...only maintenance and not resolution.” And I believe that OPS focus -- that was our focus, and a lot of that had to with simply the realities of our staffing situation. The “Boots on the ground” are officers who were at posts and who were taking on those roles, and I think fairly accurate to say low morale. They were frustrated. Some of them were left out for hours in the cold without the ability for them to be freed up or provided meals. “Lack of leadership/confidence in command - no clear direction.” I think that’s -- we did hear some of that, especially from the PLT folks. “Physical &” I’m assuming that’s mental, mentally “exhausted. Poor decision making.” I’m not sure what the “Longer” is referring to but I think the -- you know, obviously we were not our best selves at that moment and maybe weren’t making the best decisions, and the, “Information sharing [was] - incomplete and unknown command structure.” And the operational plan not being signed off.

And I think we were still relying -- at this point in time, we have since evolved, but we were relying on them being the keepers of that information and it being shared on a need-to-know basis. And you know, up until this point the major things that they were looking into were organized crime and were, you know, national security threats, not so -- I mean, that was obviously the purview of the RCMP, but those types of things.

And so he identified somebody who, you know, he trusted who would be able to feed information to us and the strategic sort of command level, and he wanted to be unfettered; he wanted to be able to execute the command as -- or execute the plan as he saw fit, and that it was in his hands, it was very much a, “I got this.”",06-094-24,94,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

You know, in this case, they had six or seven intersections, some large ground to cover, so how they would go about doing that, and it was, you know, the plan ultimately that they had was down to line-by-line as to what time they would move in, which direction of travel they would be going in, how they would contain it. The 1st of February, the chief, two of the PLT sergeants, and myself met with these POU commanders who had been in Ottawa. And I'm not sure if some of them were left over from the weekend because they had their teams here, but these were commanders who had some expertise in executing POU actions, but not necessarily in creating plans. And so when they were tasked with, at that point in time, what was a colossal area to cover, I got the sense from the group that they were -- and I certainly know that I communicated back and forth with our staff sergeant, but it was mind boggling, I think, would be a good term. They just couldn't -- you know, this was -- would have been the largest public order movement in Canada, and that’s actually what it turned out to be. And they said when we initially spoke with them, ""How do you think we could execute this?"" And they said we would need every public order unit or section in the country to be able to clear the streets the way they are now. And that was on the 1st of February. So I think -- my sense is that they struggled with trying to come up with a plan on its own, you know, just six of them sitting around a table at a hotel in Kanata, I think was thrilling for them.",06-197-03,197,3,1,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

You have the strategic, operational and tactical, so in my role as a strategic commander, my role is to help facilitate the Critical Incident Commanders that are the operational level. If they have exceptional needs or resources, they’ll come to me and I’ll try to make that available to them. My role also is as a -- to create situational awareness for OPP Command and brief OPP Command regularly as to what’s occurring. I also have some oversight on the command and control just to make sure that what our mission we’re trying to accomplish is going to be successful, so I oversee that command and control. And I also look at those areas, try to mitigate any risks that might be involved in our operations. Many of our Critical Incident Commanders are obviously very focused on the jobs they’re doing and may not be aware of what’s occurring around the outside of them, and that’s my job, to make sure their understanding of any political issues or other issues that might be going on outside that could affect what they’re operating on.

06-210-11,"Certainly. So as we saw it, as we’ve heard in evidence, we knew vehicles were travelling from across the country from the east and west and from northern Ontario to converge here in Ottawa. Well, to get to Ottawa, you have to travel through OPP jurisdictions primarily. So within each region, we had many jurisdictions on Highway 17, Provincial Highway 417, which are OPP responsibility. I had to make sure that the small communities were prepared for the large influx of convoy vehicles and protestors, so I had to create a team that could support those communities and then also I had to create a traffic plan as to how we’re going to manage the vehicles on the highway. As you heard, I think, from Superintendent Morris, there is a concern are they going to blockade highways, is there going to be damage to highways possibly, so we need to have a strategy in place to manage that if it was to occur. So we used our provincial highway blockade strategy. I had an Incident Commander create an operational plan to prepare for the arrival of the trucks and, as part of that plan, we communicated with the City of Ottawa, Ottawa Police Service to figure out how can we support them in that because they obviously had a plan for where they wanted these vehicles to be and since we controlled the 417 and the on and off ramps, they needed our support, and so we had to work together on that.",06-210-13,210,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

So I emailed Kim early in the week because I'd heard about -- I unfortunately was away from the workplace for two weeks prior to the 24th, and I knew that we regularly met when major events were coming to the national capital. Normally, we would talk to each other, and I hadn't seen an invite for a meeting.

So that was kind of the day we wanted to make sure that we had all our resources available to prepare for what with vehicle stoppages, road blockages, those types of things. And our Provincial Liaison Team, as the Commission has heard about, they were engaged with many of the convoy leaders and they talked about routes they would take and they would only take up one lane of 417, wouldn't take up all the lanes.

I was providing around 30 officers a day at this period of time to Ottawa Police, 15 on days and 15 on nights, primarily to just do traffic services, traffic enforcement just at intersections, closing roads, and I let the incident commanders like Joe Vargo and his Public Order Unit commanders work out what system they felt they needed to do with their Public Order partners in Ottawa and other services.",06-233-18,233,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

So it was clear that it was going to start getting out of my ability on a regional level to staff Ottawa police with just regional people. We were going to have to start bringing in people from all over the province so that we needed help in that logistic so we reached out to Orillia Emergency Operations Centre to say, “Okay, get ready. It’s going to be an extended event,” and we start identifying regional contacts to start relaying what Ottawa’s going to need and how many people we can get to Ottawa.

And do they understand what the true function of a CAC is? Could that be done with just an incident commander? So I think he’s just trying to clarify to them, “Can you go back to them to clarify what is it they really need because then we know what we can send them?” because there’s three levels of command.

How many cars do you want them to bring? What are their roles and responsibilities, so I can find those people with those skills.

They're obviously trained in the framework that's been adopted by the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs, which I think the Commission's heard about already.

So they were already on the ground trying to support. So I was already hearing frustrations on integration. They weren't able to be integrated. They weren't given autonomy to make decisions. So I was more communicating with Deputy Bell because they would call me and Inspector Beaudin, which the Commission will hear from who runs the PLT program, he would call me, his sergeants would call me to say, ""Sir, we're not getting anywhere here."" The actual Ottawa Police Service team's not giving autonomy to connect with convoy drivers, make a lot of those concessions, which they do. And so they were just -- they were floundering. They didn't feel they had a role. They didn't see a plan. There was no PLT plan, which normally there is a plan for PLT. There was none. So I wasn't as much communicating with them as they were communicating with me about their concerns. And part of my role as strategic commander was deconfliction. So I would reach out to Deputy Bell and say, ""Steve, this is what we're seeing and we're hearing from Chief Sloly and other commanders that PLT is important to the solution of this problem, but we're just not seeing it be operationalized."" And that's not unique sometimes if you're at a high level like a Chief and you're not seeing what's happening on the ground. Maybe that's news to Chief Sloly; right? So it was important for me on behalf of my members and for the Ottawa Police Service to bring it to their attention and see if they can make some changes to get them more autonomy, and get them more engaged, and try to stress upon Deputy Chief Bell the successes I've seen and the importance of using them to help move this forward.",06-243-26,243,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

I didn't know anything really about that until I got on the call and then I heard the story, much like Deputy Chief Ferguson told this morning. Essentially, PLT had gone to the Coventry Road site to try to negotiate the removal of some gasoline, and Major Incident Commander Patterson was aware of this and chose to use it as an enforcement opportunity. And when the gas was being driven away, his members pulled the vehicles over, seized the gas and charged the members. And that caused extreme stress amongst the PLT team, both Ottawa Police Service and OPP PLT members to the point where the Ottawa Police PLT members just said, ""You folks, you should go home. We've lost."" We've lost all -- any goodwill we were able to reach with some of the convoy organizers or operators was now lost because there's no way they could not have seen the connect between them trying to negotiate a removal of gas and then being arrested. It was too obvious. So there was much concern about that, but on this call, I learned that Staff Sergeant Ferguson, who's in charge of Ottawa Police PLT, didn't know that that was Superintendent Patterson's plan all along.

06-265-05,"Yes, I had heard, because I had heard that our POU Unit had been engaged as part of this Coventry Road exercise. So I contacted Insp. Dave Springer to say, like, “What are we doing there?” He said, “We’re just here to protect PLT. We’re not engaged with the gasoline. We’re just making sure nobody gets hurt.” And in our conversation, I had understood that even some of the Ottawa Police detectives were uncertain about their legal authorities to do what they were doing. Could they seize the trucks? Could they seize the gas? Could they lay the charges? So I wanted to talk further with Supt. Patterson to say, “Where are you getting this authority? I’m assuming you’ve consulted the Crown Attorney. What has the Crown Attorney told you about this? What was the Crown Attorney told you about your authorities? Do you have a Crown opinion letter that I could have? Because until and if I see that letter, I’m not directing my OPP members to be engaged in this type of activity, until I can be certain that the Crown Attorney supports it.” Once again, my role as strategic commander is to protect my people from -- their physical safety, but also their civil liability. I don’t want them involved in illegal arrests. It’s a difficult thing to make the connection between gasoline and a criminal offence of mischief. So there may be a memo out there, which eventually there was, the Crown Attorney was able to explain that these types of offences, as long as you can articulate them correctly, can lead to charges. I had conversations with OPP senior command either the next day or two days later, once I got the letter. Once they saw it in that conversation, they said, “No, it’s okay. OPP members can participate in this type of activity.” So then I had to work my incident commanders to build a training package for my members to say, “Hey, here’s your authorities. Here’s how to approach it.” Even down to the basics about what do you do with the seized gas? You can’t throw it in the trunk of your car. Down to that level.

Being at RCMP headquarters, everybody who wanted to be on the call could be on the call at that time. But we gained very good ground. We had good conversations. We requested -- Deputy Ferguson stated that they were just finishing up a larger concept of operational plan. It just wasn't quite ready yet. She indicated it'd be ready the next morning.

06-274-14,"Certainly. It was in a boardroom on the second floor of police headquarters. Chief Sloly was present, and two deputies were present, a few inspectors. Superintendent Patterson was present. Counsel Huneault -- I apologize if I don't pronounce your name correctly. She was present. And there was myself, Chief Pardy, Inspector from York Regional Police. Tim's his first name. I apologize I can't remember his last name. Superintendent from the RCMP, Phil Lue, and Staff Sergeant Darwin Tetreault. And we all sat on one line on one table, Chief Sloly sat at a table, flanked by his deputies. They spoke -- Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson gave her presentation on the expanded concept of operations and what that looked like. After that presentation, Chief Sloly turned to me directly, which I was surprised because I just happened to be the first OPP in the line. Chief Pardy was next to me on my right. And in a clearly unhappy fashion expressed his unhappiness with the fact that the Solicitor General reported that there was 1500 OPP officers in his city when clearly there was not. And he was quite upset about that. I explained to him that I was the one who provided numbers. On the second of February I was asked by the SOLGEN's office to provide a document to show how many OPP members were in the City of Ottawa. Clearly, there was more than just frontline officers. We had Public Order officers, we had Intelligence officers, we had PLT members, we had Logistical officers, Traffic members. So my team created a chart, daily chart from the beginning to that period, 2nd of February, with rows and columns to fill in any POU and Traffic, and then the total for each day and then a total cumulative. I want to say the cumulative total at that point was 826, could be 862. It was around that number. And I stated that each day moving forward was going to average about 125 a day. And I submitted that to my Chief Superintendent, and I never saw the numbers again. So I explained to Chief Sloly that -- I didn't explain to Chief Sloly in that detail. I just said, ""I'm the one who submitted the numbers. In my opinion, I think that a SOLGEN media staffer just maybe crafted a bad sentence. The intent was not to say there was 1500 literally that day. The intent was to say it was cumulative."" Chief Sloly again became upset and basically said, ""Don't explain the politics of the SOLGEN's office to me. I know that was done intentionally."" And I just said, ""I can't speak to that. I just provided the numbers."" And we moved on.",06-274-16,274,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,SUPT. CRAIG ABRAMS,supt. craig abrams

06-276-04,"There was. So we were provided -- I want to say it was a three-page document by Superintendent Patterson that detailed kind of his daily plan. It was weekly. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and what he planned -- what they planned to do. They were dynamic actions primarily. And one of them was supposed to happen that evening at 11 o'clock. So he detailed that and basically just kind of left it there to say -- as if for us to say, okay. So sensing no one else in the room was speaking, I started to ask some direct questions to Superintendent Patterson to say, ""What are you going to do with the trucks? What's your plan with the trucks?"" He had two plans with the trucks. One plan was to use retired Ottawa police members to drive them out of there, indicated they'd been there for quite a period of time. Many of them had been chained and altered to kind of make it difficult to tow them. I'm not a diesel mechanic, but a lot of -- you probably need mechanic skills to get them started again. And he indicated, well, if that didn't work, I'd use the Canadian Armed Forces tow trucks to tow it. And I said, ""Have you asked for an aid to the civil power from the federal government?"" And Superintendent Patterson indicated that he didn't require that, it wasn't necessary. So then I asked, because I knew through those weeks, that week, I was getting regular phone calls from my PLTs, I've described about their frustrations of we're not being on the same page, no autonomy, no connection, I asked, ""Has PLT been engaged in this plan, this takedown plan?"" And Superintendent Patterson said they had. I knew they hadn't. So that concerned me. So I told them directly, I said, ""I'm not a Public Order Unit Commander, but based on what I'm seeing and what I've just heard, you will never see OPP support on any operation tonight or tomorrow based on what I'm reading."" Literally, it's two lines on a page to take down a whole intersection. There was no idea of -- no indication any way at that meeting is there children in the car? How many people are in each truck? That wasn't told to us. Essentially, they were looking for us to agree, and I wasn't comfortable. I had to ask the questions because it was dangerous for my members. That's what I’m being paid to do, protect our members and our organization. And it was at nighttime. Only in emergent extreme situations would we ever do Public Order exercises in the dark. We don't operate in the dark. It's too dangerous for our members. It's too dangerous for the public. So there were so many reasons why I could never support it. That's why I had to ask the direct questions I did.",06-276-06,276,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,SUPT. CRAIG ABRAMS,supt. craig abrams

06-277-24,"Then we transitioned and Chief Pardy and RCMP members then piped in to basically say to Chief Sloly, ""Maybe you should pump the brakes, and slow down a bit, and allow"" -- this is Darwin Tetreault talking now -- allow -- he had coordination for a Public Order Unit in the RCMP. ""I can get you bodies here to Ottawa, but it's going to take some time. Give me a week. We can get you 400 people here,” and that really seemed trigger Chief Sloly. He became very passionate, a raised voice again, and basically said that the head of hydra is in Ottawa and we needed to cut the head of the hydra off in Ottawa. Sorry, I’ll back up quickly. We also talked about the impacts around the country, that this isn’t just an isolated incident. We have Coutts, Alberta; we have Ambassador Bridge; there’s more events that happened. And I think Supt. Morris called it the “rubber band effect” or “elastic effect”; one event that happened in one part of the country has an immediate effect on another. When we tried to bring that to his attention, he didn’t want to hear that. His focus was on his city which, he’s the Chief of the City, I can’t say I blame him, but he was very passionate about he didn’t like to hear that. He didn’t like to hear about a delay and essentially said, “I want you to promise me that you will get 400 RCMP or POU members here or I will go the Minister.” He never named the minister; he just called -- just said “the Minister”.",06-277-26,277,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Whether I had those meetings with business owners after this conversation or before, I can’t recall for sure but it’s not a position I espoused because there was clearly an affect on the residents in that area. I think I may have been commenting more -- because I talked to other members about this -- if you drove the 417 through Ottawa or used any streets south of the 417, you’d never know what was happening in Ottawa.

06-284-11,"We had talked prior because prior to this date on the 17th, our members were doing traffic enforcement and -- but more in an observation capacity, looking for criminality that may be obvious or vehicles that may look like they want to block a roadway. So we had a formal education package. The EMCPA was in authority at that period of time, so we educated them on the provincial EMCPA Act. That gave them some authorities. And we educated them on their normal Highway Traffic Act authorities, their normal Criminal Code authorities, about their ability to stop traffic, determine what they're doing, and the ability to turn them around and/or make arrests if they feel they have the reasonable grounds to do so. I did a lot of the briefings with the members to explain their authorities and I tried to explain in the simple terms as I could, just saying, ""You're all police officers. You all understand your authorities to make arrests, and you all have -- you understand the concept of discretion. And these authorities are available to you here, just like they are back at your home detachments. Nothing has changed."" So this is prior to the 17th. So they knew they had those abilities. If they saw something, they could act. They didn’t need the Emergency Act to do it. But then when the Emergency Act was invoked and there was restrictions placed and ""headlines"" is the wrong word -- but restrictions or regulations put in place about boundaries and certain street boundaries and entry into those boundaries, and that members of the public entering that area had to have three or four different excuses; is there a lawful purpose, a business owner, going to a hotel. So there's three or four different areas that they were allowed to. So my officers were then expected to essentially do that. So it turned from what was officers really observing traffic to once the Act was invoked, I went downtown to see what our members were dealing with, and it was essentially a 14-to-15-hour ride program. Members were out in horrible weather, standing on the roadside, checking vehicles, going through the list, ""Where are you going, what are you doing, why are you travelling here, do you have a reason to go here?"" and then turning around vehicles that may need to be turned around.",06-284-13,284,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

06-285-26,"So it wasn’t necessarily an ask. So I was sitting in the command post. I saw our prime minister on the television revoke the Act, and I looked at my watch, and I knew I was less than an hour away from briefing 300, close to, officers that were going to go on the street that night. And I knew they were going to want to know what -- ""What can we do, Boss?"" essentially. They could see the TV as well as I could. So I had to really consider what are our lawful authorities to do that we're doing, minus the Act, Emergencies Act? So I looked at what we were doing prior, I looked at the common-law authorities to stop vehicles. It was a very restricted area. We had literally just cleared the streets almost less than 24 hours before. How could we ever just turn the streets back over again that we'd just secured less than 24 hours? We've got to have a presence and still maintain some presence of restriction in some capacity. So I tried to call Chief Pardy. He was my kind of commander and just to run it by him, just to make sure I was on the right track. Unfortunately, he was tied up. I think that announcement caught everybody by surprise, so the phones were ringing. So I appeared before them and that’s essentially what I explained to them. I said, ""Use your discretion, but we're going to continue to stop vehicles until and as such time as I'm told that the lawful authorities doesn’t exist any more. The emergency has passed."" And at the end of the day, the next morning, that’s what had happened. Our meetings were held and it was agreed there was no intelligence to indicate that convoy participants were going to return. Therefore, a common-law authority that we base our authorities on was -- didn’t exist any more. There was no emergent need, there's no intelligence to support us stopping vehicles, so the direction was made to now fall back to an observation mode again. On that first evening when I gave that direction, they continued to stop. We stopped 11 vehicles that were convoy related, according to my members, that wanted to get back into the zone that we just cleared. So I was glad that we continued it that evening. They gave lots of excuses. They wanted to pick up an old hockey net that was left behind, but who knows? Maybe that was accurate, maybe not. But the count was 11 vehicles that we turned aside, and after conversations the next day with Chief Pardy and council, they agreed the authority didn’t exist any more, so we went back to pre-Emergency Act and developed an observational posture.",06-285-28,285,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

06-287-27,"I thought the OPP role in the initial convoy arrival on Ottawa went very smooth. We had minor issues in our smaller communities with members not obeying the mask mandates. We had some restaurants who just chose to ignore the mandates altogether, but overall, we had no assaults, we had no criminality. I wasn’t aware of any charges being laid. They said what they would do. They kept to one lane. They entered the City of Ottawa in an orderly fashion. We had minor issues with supporters on the roadside on the 417 getting kind of dangerously close to the side of the highway, which was a concern, but that wasn’t convoy -- the convoy participants couldn't control that. They did what they said they would do, and they didn’t damage any highways and they didn’t cause any criminality. So from that perspective, it was a success in getting them into the City of Ottawa, from an OPP. That was our mission, that was our goal for that period of time, to have the convoy come through OPP-policed areas without a blockage of a highway, without assaults or damage and injury to the public, and we were successful in all those areas.",06-287-29,287,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

06-288-18,"And I guess the reverse side of that question is, what would you say to the suggestion that this could have been avoided if the OPP had more actively inserted itself or actively offered support, maybe no strings attached, maybe ""Here's people. Show us the plan later"", that that might have avoided the situation?",06-288-20,288,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,eric brousseau
06-288-24,"I'm not a subject-matter expert in public -- or I'm not a subject-matter expert in principles of Commander MCIC. If you're asking for my opinion, I'll give it to you, but I'm not a highly-trained public order manager. But certainly, if you could go by the intelligence and do an intelligence-led assessment of what was coming to your city, I think there was ways to block streets. I don't think you could ever stop them coming to the city at all. That was a foregone conclusion. They were coming to Ottawa. It would have been a matter of how can we lessen the impact to our city? Can we divert them to other areas of the city that have less impact? Can we divert them somewhere and then they go and they protest on foot as opposed to protesting in what is essentially a mobile house, once it's in one place it's hard to move? Monday morning quarterbacking is an easy thing. I don’t like to do that, but you asked me a question. I think that’s a way that perhaps, just like Toronto did, but Toronto admitted that they learned from the lessons of Ottawa and that’s why they blocked roads and were able to clear the Queen's Park area the way they did so effectively. So hindsight is always 20/20. So that’s my humble submission, but I'm not naïve enough to know that that is 5:49:01 with hindsight and knowledge that I would never had at the beginning.",06-288-26,288,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

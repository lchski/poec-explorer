So we're -- I guess it would be fair to say we're the government department that's charged with the oversight, stewardship if you will, the oversight of the Canadian economy. That has several dimensions in our work. So we're responsible for tax and fiscal policy on behalf of the Government of Canada. For -- we're responsible for the financial and fiscal dimension of federal/provincial relations. We're responsible for international economic policy, especially related to trade and some other things. We're responsible for the spending side of economic development and social policy of, again, across the government. And my two colleagues, who will introduce themselves, we're also responsible for economic analysis and economic forecasting on behalf of the Government of Canada. That's what Rhys Mendes on my left is responsible for.

And I think we'll probably find that most of Ms. Shuhaibar's questions will be directed to you, but if you have something to contribute to the questions I ask, please feel free to do so. If I could begin by asking you, beginning at the beginning chronologically, when, from the Department of Finance's point of view, the convoy and protest events that we've been talking about in this Commission first came on the horizon as an issue for the Department of Finance?",25-013-29,13,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
25-014-08,"We, as a standard practice, review on a real-time basis, events that we believe that are occurring that can have a meaningful impact on the Canadian economy. That's a core part of what Rhys's group does. So this issue came on our radar screen, I would say, sort of late January as events were unfolding and there were the beginnings of blockades at the Canada/U.S. border. So let me just back up a little bit from that and explain why this became such a focus of concern on our part. There are two, I think, quite important things playing out in the background here. First, as you'll recall, at the time, there was a great deal of speculation, and indeed in retrospect, Russia's invasion of Ukraine was imminent, and that was something that we were very focussed on and very concerned about the economic consequences that that would have globally and the therefore spillover consequences that that would have for Canada. And then second, because it was late January and February in the usual budget cycle, we were fully engaged in the preparation of what became the April '22 budget of the Government of Canada. And as you know, budget making is a lot about understanding what the next period of time looked like for the Canadian economy. And this is, I think, important in understanding the origins of our concerns. So if you'll recall, January/February of '22, our economy was just exiting from all of the COVID lockdowns. And we were very concerned about the extent of that recovery, the pace of that recovery, how fast we would recoup lost output, how fast we would recoup lost jobs, because really, throughout the COVID crisis, one of the government's objectives had been to minimize any economic scarring, longer term scarring that would be the result of the COVID crisis. So that, given our focus on economic recovery and the pace of recovery, there were two or three things in the environment that we were especially concerned about. These are not necessarily new things. One, as everyone knows now, the extent of the damage to supply chains and the impact that that would have on the pace of recovery. Relatedly, the, at the time, incipient issue of inflation, something that was partly the result of the supply chains, but also, it likely would flow from events in Ukraine because of the sanctions, et cetera that would follow, and the impact on the energy markets, and how that would also flow through into inflation. So supply chain was an issue, inflation was an issue, and then third, so was the level of business investment, which is a chronic issue for Canada. So all of these things, and business investment, as you know, Commissioner, they -- business investment is very much something influenced by business confidence. So you take together all of these factors, and then these disruptions come along, and they obviously contribute to the extent of the concern that we have because the Canadian economy, in our view at the time, was at a very, very fragile moment. So that was one set of concerns and very significant concerns on our part and on the part of the government. Relatedly, particularly to the issue of business investment, playing again in the background of all of this activity was pretty big changes in what was going on in trading patterns in the world. Now, that sounds like an abstract idea, but it's actually not because the Americans at the time, with Build Back Better, with the rejigging of their own supply chains, of the tendency within the United States to want to have more resilience of supply chains, many of them anchored in the United States itself, that represented a very, very major challenge to Canada because of the degree of integration of our economy with the United States. Seventy-five (75) percent of our exports go into that market. So as a result of that, and we were doing work with the Americans at the time, for instance, with respect to the treatment of electric vehicles, something that was critical to the future of the automotive industry in Canada, there was a tendency in the United States to want to treat that as an America only issue. And then again, these disruptions come along and raise issues in the eyes of the United States and in the eyes of the U.S. administration, raise issues around the reliability of Canada as a trading partner. Significant issues. To the point where issues -- you know, I'm sure we'll end up discussing this -- where issues that rose to the level of President Biden and our Prime Minister in bilateral conversations. So these were very meaning -- very meaningful issues that arose in the Canada/U.S. relationship. So that too very much entered into our thinking here that if these border disruptions that we were experiencing at the time, if they were to continue for a period of time and became a more -- an even more significant threat to the American perception of Canada as a reliable trading partner, that that was something with very severe long-term consequences, not just for the Canadian automotive industry but for a whole range of industries that we export into the United States, but the automotive industry was the centre piece, at least at that time. So that was the backdrop of why this was on our radar screen and how it became increasingly important on our radar screen going forward.",25-014-10,14,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

25-017-22,"No, that's exactly what I was hoping you would talk about, and as a matter of fact, you said we might get into more detail about the specifics of how these events had an impact on your thinking about Canada's reputational concerns and trading concerns, so if you have more to say about that, please elaborate.",25-017-24,17,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
25-017-28,"No, I think for now that's probably all right. I mean, I think that sets the scene of why this was an issue for us. It had meaningful macroeconomic consequences for us in the near term, particularly given this point I’ve made about just the sensitivity, the specific moment we were at, from an economic point of view. I mean, this was a very, very delicate time, coming out of COVID. And I think, in retrospect, we’ve seen all that now; we’ve seen how it was easy to shut down an economy but very difficult to open it up again. And we were in the process of opening up the economy, as every other country in the world was, at this -- for pretty well, at the same time. So that was -- you know, it was a very, very sensitive, delicate moment, from our point of view. And then this broader issue with the United States. I mean, we were -- there was, you know -- the Governor of Michigan, was very active and very critical of what was happening; there were multiple comments in the public media from Members of Congress, from Michigan, and other states. There was concern within the American federal government within the White House, about this issue, hence my reference to a conversation between the Prime Minister and President Biden about this. I mean, this was -- you know, this was not -- how can I put this? This was not a second-tier issue in the Canada- US relationship; this was a first-tier issue. And, you know, we were subsequently able to negotiate an arrangement with the Americans on electric vehicles, but there was no doubt that this -- these disruptions coming when they did in that process brought with them the risk that we would not be able to get the North American treatment that we were eventually able to negotiate with the Americans with respect to electric vehicles. And as I said, electric vehicles are the future of the automotive industry. So if we had not succeeded in doing that, then the particular consequences of that for the central Canadian-based automotive industry would’ve been, you know, very, very serious. So I think probably I’ll leave it there.",25-017-30,17,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,DM MICHAEL SABIA,dm. michael sabia

So there’s a high degree of integration here. And you add to that the just in time delivery of Rhys’ point that Rhys made. So we were seeing, at the time, I mean, this was having real world impacts. In Canada, on the Canadian side of the border, Ford, GM, Toyota, Stellantis, and Honda were either reducing shifts or in fact had shut down some plants because parts were no longer available. And then on the U.S. side, they were experiencing the same thing because of that integration. So Ford, GM, Stellantis, and Toyota in the United States were again either shut down or had substantially reduced shifts, which obviously has a pretty significant impact on not just the companies, but on workers.

And, you know, even that there are limits, because there’s downtime needed for maintenance, et cetera. So a short production -- a short disruption to production, it’s possible to make that up. It’s not free, because, you know, there’s a reason that the plants and the workers weren’t working those extra hours to begin with. Most likely, you know, there’s time needed to maintain the plant, for people to rest, et cetera. But it is possible, with a short enough disruption, to make up at least some of the lost production. With a longer production, as the amount of loss production accumulates, it just becomes more and more difficult to actually feasibly make that up, given the constraints in terms of how much you can actually increase production once the disruption ends.",25-031-03,31,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

As Rhys has said, a longer term one is a completely different story, and that is what led us, within the department, to be so focused on this question about finding measures that could be delivered with speed, because the objective was to try to keep the disruptions to as short a period of time as possible, for two reasons. First, if shorter, based on Rhys’s analysis, then the macroeconomic effects of them are -- other things being equal, are more likely to be relatively more modest. But second, and really important, if they were to continue, then on this other point that I made earlier about the impact on the Canada/US trading relationship and the longer-term consequences of the Americans reassessing Canada’s reliability as a trading partner, that if we could keep things short, the damage to that overall relationship is something that we would probably be able to manage our way through. If, on the other hand, the disruptions continued for a period of time, then a core concern we had was that that could have at a time when the Americans were reassessing their trading relationships with the world, and certainly with us, that that could have a very significant and durable negative impact on Canada’s economic prospect. So this issue about trying to move quickly to keep the disruptions to a relatively finite and short period of time, this is something that was -- it was just right at the core of all of our thinking within the department.",25-031-28,31,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And I think that’s what the Minister, given hat this is based on Bloomberg, that that’s what the Minister is commenting on here. Our thinking, and eventually in a further discussion with the Minister, was that actually while Bloomberg may have got some things right, what we think that they did not get right was that the impact grows over time. So for every unit of time, you get more impact than just if you’re able to contain the disruptions to whatever; a week, two weeks, whatever, but a very short period of time. That’s one thing.

I mean, you'll recall, I mean, this issue is still very much, you know, in front of us today, that as we move to a different structure of global trade than we have had for the last 25 or 30, 40 years, all of these issues about sourcing and structure of supply chains, these are all -- they've all become open questions. So you know, the concern that we had here was, again, that this is in the world of confidence and perception, if American companies or the American government began to think that they could not count on us as a reliable source of supply, then they probably would shift production.

25-047-03,"Okay. I just have one last document. So it's SSM.CAN.0000498. And so this is a memo from April 6th that was prepared by the Privy Council Office for the Prime Minister. And we can see at the top it's called ""Merchandise Trade in February 2022."" If we go down to page 2, just the first bullet under ""PCO Comment"". ""February data confirm that the border crossing blockades in February had limited impact on the flow of goods, as lower traffic at the impacted border crossings was partly offset by increased trade activity at other crossings. This suggests that border protest did not significantly disrupt the Canadian economic activity in February, in line with the advanced real GDP estimate, which anticipates a growth of 0.8%."" Do you agree with the conclusion that there wasn't a significant impact on the economy?",25-047-05,47,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. DAHLIA SHUHAIBAR,MS.

25-047-24,"So I think this -- the last estimate we did of this was the .1 to .2 percent impact on the first quarter, quarter over quarter growth. And so we haven't revisited that. That said, I think that the -- it's fair to say that the economic impact was limited, but it was limited because the duration of the blockades was limited. So I think, again, it comes back to the fact that because the duration was limited, there was some ability to ramp up production after the blockades had ended and trade had resumed. Because the blockades weren't more widespread, as in affecting bridges that were being used to reroute some of the traffic that would have gone over the Ambassador Bridge in particular, that helped to limit the impact. But had the blockades been more widespread or longer lasting, the impact would have been much bigger. I would also just add that it's not possible to say that they didn't have any impact because we know that auto plants had either shut -- many auto plants had either shut down or reduced hours, reduced shifts, so there was clearly an impact in real time. That's -- that information is clear in the public record.",25-047-26,47,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. DAHLIA SHUHAIBAR,ADM RHYS MENDES,adm. rhys mendes

And I think it's reasonable to assume that at least part of that was due to the blockades, given that we know that there were shutdowns and reduced hours at many plants.",25-048-19,48,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

25-049-03,"Yeah, so, I mean, you know, we often do assessments of things -- of events that are likely to have an economic impact in real time, because as I was mentioning earlier, we are trying to monitor the evolution of the economy. You know, we try to come up with an estimate for GDP in the current quarter and the next on an ongoing basis. So we're often doing real-time assessments, whether it's, you know, a flood or other weather event, or something like the blockades. We generally don't do ex post assessments of the impacts of events like this. The reason is, it's very difficult to actually identify the impact ex post. So, you know, you think about all of the February data that we're looking at, so whether it's the trade data, or GDP, or labour force data, there were confounding factors affecting things. So, you know, for instance, there was an Omicron wave in January of this year, which adversely affected -- which would have adversely affected economic activity, and therefore, would have affected the growth rate of economic activity between January and February, would have affected hours worked. And so there was also -- for instance, there were auto production issues in January unrelated to the blockades but related to shortages of semiconductors and other inputs, which caused auto production in January to be adversely affected. So, you know, there would be normally some ramp up in February to try to make up for that if the parts started to come in. That sort of confounds the ability to see the full effect of the blockades on auto production. So there were these various confounding factors that are always in play because there are always multiple things going on in the economy that make it difficult to provide an ex post estimate of the impact with any degree of confidence.",25-049-05,49,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

25-050-13,"Thank you. Well, the good news for you, Mr. Mendes, is you can probably get through the rest of this without answering any more questions. Feel free to if you have input, but you’ve had your workout for this morning. Where we’d like to go now is the approach that the Department took as the convoy was becoming an issue and your department was being approached to consider possible options from the Department of Finance’s point of view for dealing with the issues that the Government was facing with respect to the convoy. And let me ask you to just begin by describing when this approach was made to you, how did the Department of Finance view the tools that it could add to the Government’s kit for dealing with this situation?",25-050-15,50,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON(cont’d),MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
25-050-27,"Sure. Let me start, and then Isabelle, you may want to add. So look, as the disruptions, on the one hand, continued to materialize, and in some cases intensify, and the disruptions in Ottawa continued on, there was a general sense across the government and, you know, an interest that was expressed to have every department trying to think about are there ways in which we can develop ideas that would help bring to an end, in a good way, this very difficult situation. So there was a general interest in developing ideas, which obviously included us, but beyond that, the sort of general interest, there were a couple of other things in our minds motivating our work to try to find things that could contribute to a solution. On the one hand, I won’t belabour this again, because, you know, with the previous conversation and Rhys’ comments, I think the extent of our concern with respect to the economic issues is pretty straight forward, pretty clear. And this intense focus we had on are there things that can help end this quickly? Because as Rhys and I have tried to explain, duration is everything here in terms of its disruptive impact on the Canadian economy. So quite aside, or in addition to the general interest in various departments, can they develop ideas that can be helpful here, we wanted to, given our responsibilities for the Canadian economy, we wanted to find ways, and that was a significant motivator. The other one was we are also, given our responsibilities for the financial sector, we also take seriously our responsibility to ensure the integrity of Canada’s financial system. And Canada’s financial system being used for these kinds of purposes is not consistent, in our view, with maintaining the integrity of the financial system. So it was both our response to a general request for ideas, but within the department, it was what can we do to shorten the duration of these disruptions, given their economic consequences, and then finally, this concern that we take very seriously about the integrity of Canada’s financial system and that we safeguard that integrity all of the time. So those three factors led us to start some work on what can we do, given the legislation that we’re responsible for. So we began thinking about are there ways in which we could use the Bank Act or other pieces of legislation really centred pretty heavily on the Bank Act, also the Money Laundering and Terrorist, the ---",25-050-29,50,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

25-052-20,Yes. Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.,25-052-22,52,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON(cont’d),ADM ISABELLE JACQUES,adm. isabelle jacques
25-052-22,"That’s -- that’s -- she’s got it. Those two pieces of legislation. So we started thinking about, “Well, is there something constructive that could be done through FINTRAC?” Which is the agency responsible for Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing -- or terrorist activity. Could we do something there? And could we do something using the Minister’s authority for the Bank Act? And then to make a long story short, in the media, it was widely publicized, and it was very public, that crowdsourcing platforms were being used as a source of financing for these activities. Similarly, payment processors. And neither of those were within the regulatory perimeter of FINTRAC. So one thought process was, “Well, is there something we can do around that?” And then the second, with respect to the Bank Act, is, is there some way that we can use the Bank Act to have -- to give banks the capability to freeze bank accounts if, in their judgement, those bank accounts are being used for an inappropriate purpose? Now, again, just high-level summary here, there were a series of issues with that. One, we couldn’t do anything outside of federal jurisdiction, because the Bank Act only applies to federally regulated financial institutions. But there’s a whole wrath of financial institutions in Canada that are not federally regulated, particularly, say, credit unions, types of insurance companies, et cetera. So because we couldn’t do anything outside of federal jurisdiction, that really made pretty academic whether we could or could not do anything in federal jurisdiction, because money is fungible and it can just move from institution to another. So if we couldn’t do something that was more comprehensive, that was a pretty significant limitation on what could be accomplished. There was also a fairness issue there. I’ll give you an example. In Quebec, Banque Nationale, that’s a federally regulated institution, but Desjardins is not. And Desjardins, anyone who lives in Quebec knows that Desjardins and Banque Nationale compete pretty intensively between the two organizations. So to treat one one way and the other another way, that seemed to us to be -- you know, that’s just one example, but that seemed to us to be a pretty big problem. So that was one piece. The second piece, coming back to something earlier that I said, was whatever we could do, we wanted to do quickly, because doing it quickly meant shortening duration, and shortening duration meant avoiding the worst economic consequences that we were concerned about. But of course, pretty much anything that we could do would require a legislative change, and legislative changes, by their nature, take an extended period of time. So if our thinking process was how do we manage duration here of the disruptions, anytime we bumped into something that required a legislative change is something that was, by its nature, less attractive because we couldn’t do it quickly, and by not being able to do it quickly, it didn’t really deliver what we needed, which was relatively speedy action to shorten the duration of these disruptions.",25-052-24,52,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON(cont’d),DM MICHAEL SABIA,dm. michael sabia
25-054-25,"Okay. But we are going to - - for the reasons you just mentioned, we’ll leapfrog your initial interest in seeing if there was something you could do under either the Proceeds of Crime legislation or the Bank Act. But the memo that you did for your Minister on that point happens to capture some thoughts that I want to use as we move ahead into the legislation that was actually used. So if I could ask the Court to call up SSM.CAN.00003764? And this is a memorandum from you, Mr. Sabia, to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Minister Freeland.

25-057-24,"Yeah, that -- that started, I don't recall the exact dates, but sometime in the week of this memo, I think a little bit earlier. I had some -- I mean, as the principal regulator, OSFI and ourselves, in terms of financial -- higher-level financial policy, we have a lot of contact with the Canadian banks, Canadian financial institutions in general. So I am, as is Isabelle and her team, we are in regular contact with Canadian financial institutions pretty much of all kinds, A, because of our role in that sector; and B, because they're a very good way of listening and understanding more about what's going on in the Canadian economy than any one point. So I had some conversations, particularly with bank CEOs, during that week to get their sense of what was happening and reaction to these disruptions, and in those conversations, we were talking about that, the general -- their general take on these events and what they thought the government should or shouldn't be doing about it. And then second, general conversations around what could be done. In those early days, I did not raise the specifics of these options which would have been inappropriate at the time.

GORDON CAMERON(cont’d),MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
25-059-01,"Yeah. Well, we need to be careful here. Prior to the possibility or likelihood that the government would invoke the Emergencies Act, that was a very important dividing line here. So prior to that, in the week that we're talking about here, my conversations there would have been much more general and much more general -- much more focussed on, you know, what are they hearing from companies, what are they hearing from investors, how do they gauge the situation? It was much more our trying to understand by talking to other people whether or not our perception of the situation was aligned with how other people were perceiving it. I would say there was very much alignment around the concerns that Rhys and I have talked about earlier, and what we were hearing from institutions that basically spanned the Canadian economy and are constantly in touch with clients, and their clients are businesses and individuals across the Canadian economy, so they're good listening posts. So that was prior to the possibility of the Emergencies Act. Because as per this memo, as you can see, the conclusions that we were coming up to, they were arriving at, were conclusions that actually there wasn't really, other than through FINTRAC and that side, there really wasn't a lot that we could do in the near term without passing legislation, which as I said, would take a considerable period of time. Now, as the possibility or likelihood of the Emergencies Act being invoked, then that changed the nature of those conversations. And through I think that weekend, I forget -- the dates would have been sort of the 12th, 13th, or something of -- you have to check -- you'll have to doublecheck the dates, but you know, 11, 12, 13, somewhere in there, we then began to have conversations about in the event that the government were to decide to move down this path, because it hadn't been decided yet, how could this be done. And I would say that the reaction that we got to those initial conversations was pretty much, you know, consistent with what I had heard in the earlier conversations, which is, you know, to shorten what were long conversations that, you know, this is a serious issue and a threat to Canada's economy, what can we do to help. So there was an openness on the part of the bank CEOs to working with us to try to find solutions that would bring a peaceful end to what was a difficult circumstance. So in those conversations, we did talk about, you know, how could this work? What would you do? What would be feasible for you? Because we wanted to learn as much as we could about the actual operation of this from the people who actually operate in the day-to-day financial system of the country. So that was the nature of those conversations. And then as the weekend and time progressed and it became more apparent of the possibility that the government would move in this direction, then Minister Freeland joined me for one or two of those calls, where at that point, we were saying, okay, well, if we're going to go down this path, you know, our expectation would be for you to be able to do A, B and C.

In developing those Orders, we tried to be as practical and targeted as possible. And that’s why we wanted to ensure that information could be shared with various enforcement forces, including the RCMP. We had discussions with the RCMP and with the financial institution to ensure that we basically implemented or helped, to the extent possible, provide the information with respect to the Emergencies Act and these Orders. These are not the type of Orders -- I mean, it was the first time, I think, in 35 years, or if ever, that the Emergencies Act was ever used.

We also told people ahead of time that if they continue to fund illegal activities, or be involved in those illegal activities, that the bank accounts could be frozen.

25-078-09,"Well my daughter is finishing law school. So I don’t know. I’m of two minds about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. In any event. So what did we do? At the Department of Finance, we basically set policies. So we set a policy that said under the authority of the Emergencies Act, the Emergencies Act having already declared certain activities illegal, we set a policy that said the financial system, bank accounts, other types of accounts, should not be used in support of what was then declared illegal activity. Point 1. Point 2, we -- the way the system worked, which seemed to us to be pretty logical, which is the RCMP working with other areas of law enforcement, the people on the ground who had the information were then providing that information to a set of financial institutions who had their own processes, which they use every day for other types of fraud and other things, as Isabelle has mentioned, and they put those two things together. So that seemed, to me, to be a pretty good outcome, in that the people who had the microscopic information or the micro information of who was doing what was feeding that into financial institutions and financial institutions were using that as a positive input into the decision making that they were going to have to do. And then empirically, I mean, I think of the 280 accounts that ended up being frozen. You might want to check my numbers, but something like 256 or 257 of them came from the RCMP. So obviously there’s a pretty high correlation there. Doesn’t mean that the banks didn’t do some additional things, because obviously there’s a difference between 257 and 280. But yes, your point being that the RCMP’s work, based on in the field, understanding of who was doing what, had a significant bearing on what the banks did. So that seems to me to be pretty reasonable -- in terms of implementing a policy, a pretty reasonable set of ways of going about doing it.",25-078-11,78,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

I mean, in the first -- when you go to the deterrent mode, because you’re starting to affect more than the protestor, and you know that; right? In the first scenario, you’re saying to the protestor, “We are going to cut off the money you’re using to buy gas for your truck,” or whatever.

Like, we’re thinking, you know, we wanted to stop the flow of funds to fund those illegal activities and we wanted it to act as a deterrent. So for those people on the Hill or in other border crossings involved in illegal activities, we wanted to dissuade them from continuing their participation. As we said repeatedly, what was important was that one of the key features was we wanted to act quickly, as we said before. So as quickly as we could freeze -- the accounts could be frozen, they could be unfrozen as well. And the person that made a decision to stay involved in those criminal activities or illegal activities, it was their decision to stay there. Certainly are we conscious of the fact that we do not want, of course, you know, we did have questions and we had discussions with the CBA with respect to, you know, court order, like, for child support for example. We certainly said, as you saw in the Emergency Order, there is a section that basically indemnifies people from, you know, implementing -- doing their best to use their judgement to implement the order and the measures that are there. Certainly we said the goal was not to punish or prevent, you know, payments of child support. That was not the goal.

25-118-04,"Hi. My name is -- actually, good afternoon. My name is Sujit Choudhry and I’m counsel for the CCF, for the record. So Ms. Jacques, I want to take you to the issue of the freezing the accounts. I know that we’ve talked a lot about that today. And I want to invite you to answer some questions about lessons learned from that process and experience, which I take it was fairly unprecedented in Canadian history, because part of the Commissioner’s mandate is to advise governments in the future about how to -- if and how to use these tools and how they might be adjusted. So if we could just do that for a minute? So you’ve heard that for some individuals, and we’ve had testimony to that effect, that because their accounts were frozen, they weren’t able to meet their basic necessities. It might be child support, rent, food. In one case, we had a witness testify that he couldn’t buy heart medication for his son. And I think we can all agree that was not the intent of the order. And so I want to put to you this question that you’ve said, “Listen, whatever the order said on its face, when we provided advice to financial institutions about how to administer it, we asked that they use discretion.” But wouldn’t it have been better to put humanitarian exception into the terms of the order itself to ensure there was crystal clarity, not just to those institutions, but to members of the public who could have looked at the order online, but would not have had access to that advice provided to banks and credit unions, that in fact they had that right to obtain monies that they needed to make -- to obtain monies that they required to meet their basic needs?",25-118-06,118,6,4,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

I mean, looking at it -- you know, one of the key points that we did look at at the outset when drafting, and you must understand we were working on this fairly quickly, looking at a de minimis amount. But you also understand that a number of people were donating small amounts to crowd funding platforms; right? And so there was always that possibility. But looking at it, if we were to do it, I think we could craft some exceptions for the application for very specific cases. It’s not something that we did in the time that we had, but I don’t disagree with you that it’s something, you know, in hindsight that we could look at in being more specific in that regard, because the intent was not to effect -- unduly effect, you know, payments of child support or other payments.",25-119-09,119,9,7,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

25-119-21,"Thank you. And maybe a broader question on the same theme, or on a related theme, to the panel as a whole, which is about consumer credit. And so I think the panel would agree that credit histories and credit scores, although kind of privately administered, are an important form of social and economic capital that citizens have. They require those scores to get credit cards, to get mortgages, to get loans, and so forth. And there’s been evidence that you might not have heard, but I’ll ask you to take my word for it, that some individuals who had their accounts seized, and subsequently those accounts released to them, nonetheless have had lingering effects on their credit history because of mis-payments. And that might not be an effect -- and so to your point, Mr. Sabia, that the Act was only used for a limited time period, that might be true, but the lingering effects of a decline in someone’s credit history or credit score could take place or be experienced over many months or many years. And should there not have been some thought and some aspect of the order that would have taken into account the long-term effects on individual’s credit histories and credit scores by the temporary freezing of their accounts, even if only for a short period of time?",25-119-23,119,23,21,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

And the -- let’s put this -- let’s back up a little bit. The government announced its intention to proclaim or to invoke the Emergencies Act on the 14th. It was very clear, very clear, as of that date, and the Minister of Finance was very clear as of that date, that people involved in these disruptions ran the risk of having their accounts frozen. That was very clear. So there was a period of notice there and it was very clear that all that had to happen was for those people to leave and as -- if they did, their accounts would never have been frozen, or that they would be immediately unfrozen if they did leave.

And the preliminary thought from the OPP was that the compensation would be through federal funds available to support the Emergency Response to reopening the crossing.

I'm counsel for the Ottawa Coalition of Residents and Businesses, and I just have a few hopefully short questions for you today. To begin, I would ask the clerk to please pull up a document. It's Document SSM.CAN.00001319_REL.0001.

So this would be at the top. It's an email sent February 14th. We see the from and to information's redacted as personal information at the top, but if you scroll to the bottom of page 2, we see that this email originated from someone in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. And we can go back up to the top, please, Clerk. So my understanding that this email is that it is an email communicating information about the names of 201 trucking companies whose trucks were identified as participating in the convoy demonstration within Ottawa. The email then shares which of these 201 companies accessed the CEWS, which I understand refers to the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. So -- and the email goes on to note that 45 of these 201 trucking companies were identified as active in that subsidy. So my question for the Panel is just whether any of you were aware that this information was being compiled within the department and then for what use, is my question?",25-156-18,156,18,16,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

So I'll just move to another brief area which I'm sure you can provide me some assistance. This is with regards to clarifying some of the evidence that you provided regarding the aggregate data that the department received about the frozen accounts pursuant to the order. Mr. Sabia, you told us that approximately 280 accounts were ultimately frozen, and for your assistance, I I believe that that’s the number that’s also contained within your institutional report.

25-161-10,"Good afternoon. It's Stephen Aylward. I'm one of the lawyers for the Government of Canada. Mr. Sabia, earlier this morning, you mentioned a concern around the electric vehicle credits in the context of discussions with or issues with the United States. I just wonder for those who may be unfamiliar with that issue if you could just explain a bit more about why it was and why it was a concern for you.",25-161-12,161,12,10,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. STEPHEN AYLWARD,MR. STEPHEN AYLWARD,stephen aylward
25-161-19,"Sure. In the U.S. legislation, since passed, they provide -- there had always been a certain level of subsidy for electric vehicles, and that level of subsidy one way or another was matched because they were quite small on the U.S. side and on the Canadian side. The proposal was a dramatic increase in the level of government subsidy for electric vehicles that were assembled only in the United States. That was -- it is a dramatic increase. So the issue for us was that if that remained the case, and that electric vehicle assembly was done on an American basis not a North American basis, then a Canadian industry would be at a very, very substantial disadvantage, and that in effect, we would either, as a much smaller country, have to match the magnitude of those subsidies or have, in effect, over time the automotive industry migrate into the United States. The automotive industry, you know, is an extremely important part of the Canadian economy, and an essential part of the central Canadian economy. So finding a -- working toward a North American approach to the assembly of electric vehicles was something that was very important to us and to those companies, and especially to autoworkers. So that's why the concern that was being expressed in the United States that Canada's no longer reliable raised such a serious issue for us because if that was the political perception, then our chances of being able to convince Washington to adopt a North American approach to this, which of course required a level of confidence that auto parts and cars could move across the border pretty seamlessly, if we were not successful in doing that then as I say there would be a very severe economic consequence for -- I mean, there are 500,000 workers in Canada directly and indirectly whose jobs depend on - - I mean, it's a very, very important sector.",25-161-21,161,21,19,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

We had no level -- no reason to believe that those disruptions had come to an end, period, at the time, prior to the time of the Government's decision with respect to utilising the Emergencies Act. And indeed, it was -- that was one of the significant factors that there was no way of judging whether we could find ourselves in a situation of kind of rolling disruptions across various border points of entry. Had that occurred and had we been unable to manage that situation, I think the reaction in the United States, in the politically important State of Michigan and in the Federal Government, would have been to very seriously question Canada's ability to continue to act as a reliable trading partner.",25-163-25,163,25,23,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

Given that inventories had been drawn down during the period of disruption, the return to a disruption at the bridge would have put us more into, like, a second week situation where, based on our own past experience and discussions with Transport Canada, you know, that could reasonably be up to, like, three-and-a-half times the size of the impacts that we were discussing for the first week.",25-164-15,164,15,13,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

It means lower incomes for workers. It means communities less able to count on certain companies. I mean, there are real human consequences to these numbers, whether it's an auto worker, or whether it's someone in the food sector in western Canada and their ability to pay mortgages, et cetera.

25-165-21,"Well, I think in an ideal world, these disruptions had already gone on. They varied, the length by where they were in the country, but these disruptions had already gone on for a reasonable period of time, so -- reasonably lengthy period of time. So our objective here was we were thinking about this in a, you know, a period of several days or a week, perhaps a bit more than a week.

And so in my job, what I do is I do coordinate the national security community.

So this is an email from Mike MacDonald, who we understand to be Assistant Secretary of Security Intelligence to you, Jackie Bogden -- Jacqueline Bogden, who is Deputy Secretary Emergency Preparedness and a variety of people. So to situate you in time, this was Tuesday, January 22nd, so ahead of the arrival of the convoy. There's a - - so I'm going to take you through a couple of points in this email. If we can just scroll down a little bit, Mr. Clerk? Okay. Just a little bit more. Here we go. Thank you. So at this point, ""In monitoring the convoy thus far, the RCMP and other [Law Enforcement] report that it is peaceful [participate to] being lawful and disciplined as they have an objective of arriving in Ottawa on-time/as planned. While the current convoy is peaceful, concern lies around whether any individuals might join the convoy [...] who are not aligned with peaceful protest..."" And then there's some media reporting, YouTube videos and some comparison to some people who might like to see a January 6th Capitol Hill type event. Just scroll to the next page, please? And we see there's some talk of social media, content targeting some Ministers around the bottom of the page there. And then -- sorry, keep scrolling a little bit, Mr. Clerk, here we go. Then there's, ""CSIS has received media queries lately about the convoy and CSIS' role in any monitoring activities."" And there's a bullet here where Mr. MacDonald says, ""This is a sensitive area for CSIS as the CSIS Act defines that CSIS cannot interpret lawful advocacy, protest or dissent as to the security of Canada unless it is in conjunction with defined threat activity to the security of Canada as defined in section 2 of the CSIS Act, for example, espionage, sabotage, FI ---"" -- I think it's foreign interference -- ""--- serious violence, destruction or overthrow by violence of a constitutionally-established system of government.""

And CSIS cannot surveil a lawful protest. Now, if there are individuals who are subjects of theirs, investigations in that, they can monitor the activities of those individuals, but they cannot scan, surveil, watch a protest anticipating violence, looking for subject to follow.

Who has authority to pay attention to the online space and Chatter? That’s to Parliamentarians, our other ministers, opposition leaders, or Parliamentarians under similar threats? What would engagement look like? Should MPs meet with the convoy while in Ottawa? Is this safe, and do we have advice for them? What will be the specific advice to ministers on this issue?

At the same time, after the first weekend, we saw behaviour on the streets that indicated they were settling in for quite some time, you know, wheels were removed from rigs so that they couldn't be towed, supply lines were being set up.

So I want to ask you about something specific in this meeting which, if we scroll down to page 9 of the PDF, I believe -- so, in evidence that we’ve heard before before the Commission, we’ve been through most of this already. There’s on specific point have to do with you. It notes at the end here that you’d: ""Noted it was a positive meeting and regrets to end on this following point. Would the province be looking to the federal government if this protest was happening outside the City of Ottawa, for example, happening in other places like Kingston."" So Mr. Mario Di Tomasso, Deputy Solicitor General, testified here a couple of days ago -- a couple of weeks ago, sorry, and his impression of that comment was that this was the federal government trying to wash its hands of this entire thing.

25-195-18,"Absolutely not. From where we sat, all three levels of government needed to be involved. And the federal government was very involved. The RCMP was meeting constantly with the Ottawa Police Service. We were working to understand and that elements of the people on the streets of Ottawa were and what they intended to do. So that was the intelligence side of things. We were looking at what federal Acts and authorities could be used to have the rigs moved and the truckers leave downtown Ottawa, and we want to know what provincial laws could be used and would be enforced to ensure we could clear the streets. Mr. Di Tomasso, his answer was, “Well, it’s a federal jurisdiction.” Ottawa is a city in Ontario and the provincial accountability is the same for Ottawa except for a very small precinct on Parliament Hill. But where the majority of the protests were, is a municipality. And so I found that Mr. Di Tomasso, while friendly and cooperative, was very hands off, and I didn’t understand why, and I wanted to make the point that we’re not Washington, DC. Ottawa is a municipality of Ontario. And so very simple things like the Ontario Police Services Act, which requires Ottawa Police Service to go to the OPP for additional resources is -- were additional resources going to be provided to Ottawa to assist?",25-195-20,195,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So the first thing is -- and this is in reference to something that you said in your interview, and it’s something that’s also said in the Institutional Report, and I want to clarify what it means for the Commission. In the interview, you’d explained that your role at the IRG meetings, and any time you were briefing Cabinet, was to provide a full and frank factual threat picture to Cabinet or to the IRG. And again, then, in the Institutional Report, it said -- I don’t think we need to turn it up but the briefings that you gave did not include advice or recommendations.

As we were moving into having blockades at border crossings, pop-up convoys across the country, as well as the situation in Ottawa, I gave a consolidated view of what was happening across the country, what we were seeing in terms of manifestation; intelligence that said there were going to be new convoys or maybe there weren’t; what we saw from CSIS on the IME, the ideologically-motivated-extremist front; any arrests, those kinds of high-level details that gave a -- framed the discussion that the prime minister was going to have with other officials in his cabinet, ministers.

Distinguishing a credible threat, an identifiable person with an identifiable threat that looks like they have the capability to execute that threat, so not only intent but capability, is sort of the formula used to understand if a threat is credible or not. The problem is online people are difficult, in some cases, close to impossible to identify. Throw burner accounts, et cetera, it is easy to hide an identity online.

25-225-24,"The other area I’d like to take you back to briefly just to elaborate on a little bit is this idea of the law enforcement gap in reporting. So for that, can we pull up the witness summary again, please? So it’s WTS, a bunch of zeros, 71, and to the bottom of page 7, please. Okay, so we’ve discussed here two different sort of intelligence gaps that you’ve identified. One is the social media gap that you’ve spoken about, and we may speak about again; the other is the law enforcement intelligence gap. So what you’ve expressed here is a slightly more elaborate than you’d expressed earlier today, but you didn’t receive -- and this you and Assistant Secretary Mike MacDonald, Security and Intelligence -- did not receive direct reports from law enforcement partners such as OPP, OPS, WPS -- so that’s outside the “federal family”. You can tell I’m learning the lingo. That constituted another significant intelligence sharing gap. Assistant Secretary MacDonald recalled a significant delay in receiving updates from the RCMP given the RCMP’s policy obligation to consult with each relevant agency prior to sharing investigative and operation information. And you clarify that neither you nor your staff received SITREPs, so situational reports, projects reports, or other forms of information directly. And, as you mentioned today, you hadn’t heard of Project Hendon, specifically. And if we just scroll down a little bit, it also says there that you learned of the Coutts arrests through the media, not directly from the RCMP. And just scrolling down a little bit again: ""Sharing among all three levels of government information and intelligence in relation to the convoy could have been better.""

General tactical operational information on a day-to-day basis, I don’t have any need for from the RCMP but when we’re in a situation like this -- it’s a crisis; I’m coordinating the town; the RCMP is aware I’m coordinating the town -- I’m asking for information about what’s happening, what’s coming, what they expect, what -- not, again, operational planning but what is going to happen, what law enforcement is talking about, what their concerns are, because there are ways I can help, potentially.

There is -- it was a discussion about lawful and unlawful, violent and peaceful, and can you be unlawful and still, for all intents and purposes, peaceful, meaning you're not January 6th? And is that line of violence only measured when you are at the January 6th stage and status, series of events? Or is the violence that people were -- of Ottawa were experiencing on the streets, the inability of people in Windsor to conduct their lives in the neighbourhood where the blockade, the inability of the Town of Coutts to function, is that a line? And so where is that? And I don't have an answer for it, but it is something that we have to consider as situations like this perhaps become more of the norm. And the -- what we were discussing is that the only measure can't be violence of a nature of January 6th. That can't be well this is something different or January 6th is about to happen; therefore, it is now not illegal but a national security threat. There is a spectrum of activity and behaviour and threat in there that we need to understand, and so that was the nature of the conversation. And it's one that's continued. I can't tell you that I have a paper on it yet. We don't have a policy -- a paper going forward to the Clerk, but it is a conversation that is continuing because it's critical.

There is unlawful at some point, we don't know precisely where that line is you've said, but the need to protect lawful protest in all circumstances where possible. Was there any thought given, and I'll wait for the reference to turn up here, but in your recollection, was there any thought given in the discussions around how to intervene once it became clear that there was going to be intervention, in what was happening in Ottawa, specifically, I suppose it would apply across Canada, but specifically in Ottawa to protecting lawful protest, so a subset of that protest? Was there any thought given to, okay, well, you can't do it on Wellington Street, but maybe you can go somewhere else? And I'll just situate you a little bit here. Can we turn down to page, I believe it's page 2, but it could be a bit later. Sorry, keep scrolling, I'll find it. Keep scrolling, please. No, I guess no. Page 5, sorry. Yeah, okay, there we go. So this is a description, and I realise it's not your description it's the RCMP I believe, but... Keep scrolling a bit down, please, Mr. Clerk. I'll tell you when you got it. Okay. Yeah: ""The focus of the operation today has been on clearing protesters south of Wellington and reinforcing barriers. Protesters remain at Bank and Sparks...have been advised that they will be arrested if they do not leave. Public order units continue to wear tactical gear but police tactics remain focused on de-escalation."" This is February 20th: ""Police are also monitoring a gathering that has formed at the War Museum of approximately 100 people and a smaller gathering of 30-50 at Confederation Park....information suggests some indication some protesters are staying in the secure zone...""

And it says here: “The ‘Freedom Convoy’ [..] is not an unprecedented event.” Again talking about societal alienation, civil unrest, and social polarization. Then it says: “…the convergence of several elements make this protest […] somewhat more sophisticated and unique: the use of social media for organizing and communicating both internally and externally, the use of misinformation and disinformation to promote certain narratives, the use of crowdfunding […] cryptocurrenc[y], blockade tactics and logistics, the virulence of discourse towards government and elected officials, appropriation of national symbols, …” And it goes on.

And if we just scroll down a little bit, the movement -- talks about the IMVE aspect. “It is unlikely that premeditated violence will take place, however, [the threat of] ‘lone actors’…” Scroll down again. “…significant international financial support and publicity.” So it’s sort of collating the information that was available then. And then it says: “The “Freedom Convoy” itself or new entities that emerge from it are likely to continue for several weeks and will seek new opportunities to protest, occupy and disrupt. It may also embolden other groups and individual movements across the ideological spectrum. There are also risks that the protests may serve to deepen and harden new and existing cleavages within Canadian society.

25-244-22,Right. But there isn’t -- what they said and the interpretation of what they said are two entirely different things. Their mandate is very narrow.

Flags can have multiple meanings and are routinely co-opted by various groups/ individuals. No way of connecting those views holding flags with any online content.

That when there is something like a convoy as we saw here in Ottawa, and there is open source information that “We’re going to target a school and we’re going to do a slow roll around the school.” And that information maybe is being monitored by the police so they can do something. I don’t actually know. But there needs to be an understanding that the individual who said that isn’t under a criminal investigation. We’re not even sure that the behaviour is criminal but it says something about what is happening in the middle of a crisis or an incident. I don't want to know who said it. And I need a legal framework to do this. So it’s not monitoring. It’s not individuals. It’s understanding trends just as we do with foreign intelligence.

So a first example, you’ve spoken about a concern that, it seemed to me, perhaps gave rise to this interest doing more in the way of social media intelligence work, you know.

25-315-21,"Yes, on case-by-case events. And so what my concern is is broader than that. The RCMP may tell you -- and I’m giving you a number. It’s not necessarily the correct number -- that there were five actionable threats against the prime minister last year, and they investigated all of them. We have a concern in the intelligence -- in the security community at the deputy minister level, and certainly within PCO, about the rhetoric that is online. So five actionable threats that they investigate -- and they may arrest somebody, or they may warn somebody, or do any of the things that police agencies do -- but in fact there’s 1000, maybe 1500 threats of various nature that are going affect other things that the prime minister does. That says something about the discourse and the concern out there. And so it is a nuanced thing to try to explain but we have a responsibility to understand -- we have a responsibility to understand the country, and not on a case-by- case basis, on the mood, the tone. And some of that’s intelligence and some of it is other parts of -- various arms of government, but I think that we are a little blind on what is going on in society and we are -- in terms of the prime minister’s protection, as an example, we are seeing a change in the environment that he is in. We are seeing an increased level of anger and we’re -- it’s more than just him; it's other public officials as well.

25-320-11,Thank you. We haven’t spent any time today -- and I’d like to spend a little bit of time -- discussing your role coordinating the response of the federal government to the events that were occurring in Ottawa and across the country. So can you describe to the Commissioner what role you played there and what the federal government was doing in that regard.,25-320-13,320,13,11,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,donnaree nygard
25-320-18,"Thank you. So as it has been said in my interview summary and in our institutional report PCO has that central coordinating function for the Government of Canada on a number of issues on just about every issue that goes through to Cabinet. We play a coordination function. We have a challenge function. And when there is a crisis -- and this has been for as long as the position has existed -- the NSIA on this kind of a crisis plays a lead role. Much of the organization of meetings and documentation and briefing to ministers was organized by Jackie Bogden who is the new Deputy Secretary for Emergency Management at PCO. But what we did was bring colleagues together with their experts to discuss and try to understand how the federal government could assist in the resolution of not only the blockade here in Ottawa but the various convoys that were occurring across the country. Because we’ve talked a lot about Ottawa today but we haven’t talked as much about the Ambassador Bridge, and we certainly haven't talked about Coutts. And then the continual popup convoys that were happening over this period in time. We used the forum of DMOC which you have heard that acronym to bring together the lead agencies. And we added additional departments. For example, the Deputy Minister of Justice joined us for many of our discussions. And because PCO was so very involved at every level in terms of the management of the national crisis, I invited other deputy secretaries to come to DMOC and certainly the clerk and the deputy clerk had a standing invitation. We wanted to have as broad a view as we could of what was going on and why it was happening and how the federal government could use existing authorities and resources to respond. You've heard the discussion of the tow truck strategy. Well, that came out of discussions at DMOC. The work that Deputy Minister Stewart was leading on engagement, that came to DMOC for original discussion before it went to Cabinet. But that was where we brainstormed, aired ideas, and assigned tasks to various people and departments, and PCO, to follow up. Most of the work was tasked from DMOC down into ADM and SOPs and they went off and engaged because ADMs are that engine that do that level of work. We briefed ministers almost daily, the core group of ministers. We did have formal Cabinet meetings as you've seen. The Safety, Security, and Emergency Management Committee, Canada and the World -- we used Canada and the World because there was already a scheduled meeting to discuss Ukraine. The right group of ministers were there so we briefed this as well. We had briefings to the Prime Minister and then the IRG was invoked. And the full Cabinet meetings leading up in between SSE, Canada and the World, and the IRG, were also the vehicle to get information to the Prime Minister. We tried to be very methodical in how we tracked what was on the table to review, to pursue, to engage with provincial and municipal colleagues on and that was the trackers that you’ve seen in the evidence, developed out of there. So I did not tell any deputy minister what they should do nor what they should not do. We would agree on courses of action, what ministers were going to be briefed, how we were going to engage ministers, and the plans to try and use federal authorities and work with provincial authorities to resolve individual situations. But it is a coordination group where we talk -- we discuss operational issues and each department goes back and does their own thing and reports back in. And it’s a relatively effective use of time and energy. And it became every day going through department by department. Yesterday you said this; what’s changed? What are you doing tomorrow?

She wanted us to think differently and think more broadly. And to understand this situation although it was acknowledged by the security deputy ministers, was unique in terms of its expanse across the country, that there was a thread across all of the incidents that said something and that we needed to look at it from that perspective as well as the individual resolution of problems. Yes, the tow truck strategy is an example that was very very important.

25-324-28,And you spoke to my friend for the City of Windsor about your discussion with Homeland Security in the United States. Can you tell us a little bit more about that?,25-324-30,324,30,28,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,donnaree nygard
25-325-04,"The Deputy Homeland Security -- Deputy NSA for Homeland Security is Liz Sherwood-Randall. She reached out to me to say, ""we have a concern about the Ambassador Bridge."" You've heard that concern from others. She said nothing different than what has already been heard. The President had been hearing from auto companies, he'd been hearing from governors. What was the situation? What could I tell her, and how did they -- how could they help?",25-325-06,325,6,4,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,MS. JODY THOMAS,jody thomas
25-325-12,So fair to say that they were expressing considerable concern about the situation?,25-325-14,325,14,12,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,donnaree nygard
25-325-14,"Absolutely concerned, but no pressure. They'd experienced their own protests. They knew they were complex.

25-325-19,"So when we get to the period of February 13th and 14th, and you've talked about your role in coordinating the information that's coming from various intelligence communities within the Federal Government, and pulling that all together to provide advice to the Prime Minister. In the period February 13th and 14th, what was your assessment of the situation that was going on across Canada at that point?",25-325-21,325,21,19,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,donnaree nygard
25-325-27,"My assessment was that this was an entrenched movement; that the convoys were feeding off of each other; that they were causing significant economic instability; that the violent rhetoric was increasing rapidly and exponentially; that the number of threats against public figures were increasing; that we were seeing, I don't know if I've said this, seeing increased IMVE rhetoric that was concerning. Our concern on that front is not that any of the organisers of these various groups were going to take action themselves, but they were going to inspire a lone wolf. And our experience in Canada is that of the injuries and deaths that have been caused by ideologically motivated individuals, none of them have been known, they've all been inspired by online movements and rhetoric to do something and to act. And we have profound concern about that. Coutts was a point in time of huge concern because we'd been told there were weapons found in Coutts. I can't say that anybody was surprised there were weapons. We expected weapons to show up in various locations, or anticipated that they could, but that it was of the magnitude that it was was a significant concern. And the same language was being used in Ottawa. OPS said there were weapons in some of those rigs. Well, what did that mean? One person had a gun or that there was another group similar to Coutts? What we didn't know was as significant as what we did know. And we were at the point where we were going into the fourth weekend because we were through the third weekend without resolution, and in fact, it was growing. Ambassador Bridge, yes, moving towards being resolved, but intel every single day that new convoys were being formed to take back the bridge or they were going to take the Peace Bridge or they were going to do both. There were convoys coming from across the country to reinforce Ottawa. If that had become violent, and of course we're working on inabsolute information and nothing is -- there is no intelligence that says tomorrow there is going to be an attack. But if it had become violent, knowing what we know now, there was not the police on the ground to manage it. And so you have to work in a world where you don't have absolutes and you have to use your best judgement on what to do, and what had to happen was it had to end.",25-325-29,325,29,27,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

25-327-14,"And you've made clear, I think in your earlier testimony, that your view that the section 2 CSIS Act definition, as applied by CSIS in the context of their particular mandate to investigate and collect information on individuals or groups, is very narrow.

25-327-21,--- that's your position?

25-327-28,"You were asked by the Commission Counsel about whether your views were asked at the February 13th IRG regarding whether the Emergency Act should be invoked, and you said that you had indicated yes at this time. Can you tell us why?",25-327-30,327,30,28,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,donnaree nygard
25-328-05,"For the reasons I described earlier. That we -- if the powers existed in legislation they were not being used or couldn't be used, and that we needed to take swift and decisive action to bring this national crises to an end. We needed to compel tow trucks. We needed to have an exclusion zone so that people could no longer join the convoy. And the funding and the logistics chain that supported, particularly in Ottawa, but in other locations as well, the funding was significant, and so we needed to understand the money. And I know that Deputy Minister Sabia explained that earlier today. The combination of the tools that were put into the Emergency Act, time limited, as restrictive as possible, and as transparent as possible, was determined to be by the Governor in Council the most appropriate action to take at that moment in time to end what was going on across the country.",25-328-07,328,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

25-328-21,"And finally, can you tell us a little bit about how mis- and dis-information in the context of the convoy impacted on your decision-making and your advice and your assessments?",25-328-23,328,23,21,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,MS. DONNAREE NYGARD,donnaree nygard
25-328-25,"So mis- and dis-information is a very hot topic, and everybody presumes that the mis- and dis-information has to come from foreign sources and be foreign interference. And so there was a question that was discussed at one point about whether, you know, Russia was fomenting the dis-information. The mis- and dis-information, mis- and dis-information it could be said is at the root of some of this problem of the convoy and the anger about vaccines and mandates and masks. The problem with it is that it occurs in the social media space and threads pick up on each other and they generate more. And so if you believe mis-information that's all you're going to see because you search for it and the algorithms feed it to you. We're actually working with social media companies to understand how the algorithms feed mis- and dis-information, and more significant, terrorist information that's come out of what happened in Christchurch. And it's quite well-known that Christchurch call. And misinformation means that people -- and disinformation -- have one source of information and it continuously feeds upon each other. We heard misinformation during this hearing when somebody mentioned that they were not going to put DNA-altering medication in them. There is no DNA-altering medication, but it’s believed. And so it made it very difficult to try and build a fact base for health officials, for police officials. There was misinformation during the convoy, for example, that the prime minister had signed a letter. He had not, but it circulated through the convoy here in Ottawa like wildfire. Absolutely incorrect but it became fact for people, and it becomes fact very easily, and that sowed some of the seeds of discontent that we have seen.",25-328-27,328,27,25,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

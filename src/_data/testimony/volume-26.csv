And in addition to that, he also asked Minister -- the Minister to play convening -- exercise a convening and coordinating role to support both the Prime Minister and the Cabinet in the acute phases of emergency response.

26-012-24,"Okay. Okay, the next thing I'll ask you to do is briefly explain the role of Emergency Preparedness in responding to Requests for Assistance. So can you tell us what a Request for Assistance is, a request for federal assistance, RFA is the acronym, and the process by which it's reviewed?",26-012-26,12,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
26-013-02,"That question's for me? Sorry. There's a framework whereby provinces can make a request for federal assistance in certain circumstances, where they just need help in managing an emergency, and you see that in different situations. So after Hurricane Fiona, for example, you saw the military deployed for sandbagging and logistics and things like that. That's generally done under an RFA. Our role in that tends to be kind of at the level of coordination. It's actually our partners at Public Safety that really manage the core of that process. So a request comes in. Normally, with some advance warning, there's often discussion with the Province beforehand as to what's being sought, why, whether all available resources have been considered and utilised in the province. We're usually aware that it's come in. As it comes in, we know it goes to Public Safety, there are discussions between Public Safety and the Minister's office in terms of determining the outcome, and in the normal course, our response in the form of a letter would normally go to the province, and resources are deployed, or not, in accordance with the decision.",26-013-04,13,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

One of the many things we're doing in this Commission is attempting to sort out who does what within the Federal Government and it's not always an easy answer. That's helpful. Okay. We're now going to move to the meat, essentially, of what we're going to talk about today, which is your role in convening and coordinating the Federal Government's response to the Freedom Convoy. And I'll just let you know, in the time that we have, given -- in an attempt to sort of use our time productively, given that we heard from the NSIA yesterday, and we'll be hearing from the Clerk and the Deputy Clerk this afternoon, we're going to be concentrating on the first couple of weeks, so sort of right up until the first IRG. We'll go a little beyond that, but that's where I anticipate we're going to be focussing our efforts this morning.",26-013-24,13,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS.

26-014-14,"Okay. So I guess the first part of our role, obviously PCO plays, you know, as it does in many different situations, it helps to coordinate the Federal Government response to any given situation, and the same would be true in this case. And -- so what we're trying to do in coordinating that response, we'll convene departments and agencies together, we're trying to develop a common understanding, a common, kind of up-to-date understanding of the situation and assess that situation. We're determining, you know, what are the actions that the Federal Government needs to take in response to the situation or might need to take. And the objective there is really to make sure that, you know, we're ready to do whatever's needed, the efforts are coordinated, and ideally, that the course of action is effective. So what we would've been doing in this case, like the Emergency Preparedness Secretariat, you would have heard, for example, from others who testified earlier this week, that there was a governance structure set up at the Deputy Minister level. There was governance that was set up at the ADM level to facilitate that sharing of information. What we would be doing is, then, in the, you know, let's say in the week preceding the arrival of the demonstrations in Ottawa, helping ensure that that information that is being collected is flowing in to, for example, staff of the Office of the Minister of Emergency Preparedness, staff in the Prime Minister's Office, so that they have visibility over this -- something that is on the horizon that is happening, what information do we know, what do we not know, what action are we taking, and they have confidence that, you know, the Federal Government across departments and agencies is doing what it should do in response to this kind of situation.",26-014-16,14,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So when we spoke in your interview, you identified January 30th as sort of the day that it became clear to you that the convoy wasn't going anywhere fast and there would have to be some coordination. I won't say response at that point, necessarily, but some coordination of what the Federal Government was going to do about this at this point.

26-016-01,"--- just to... So in that week, I think our efforts really began in seriousness in the week in advance of the arrival of the demonstrations; right? So the briefing that I was mentioning for, you know, the Office of the Minister of Emergency Preparedness, the Prime Minister's Office, we were also, as we got closer to the weekend, thinking about making sure that ministers, also, had a collective and common understanding of, you know, what we knew about the weekend. And so we would've started briefing, having joint briefings with ministers the Thursday before the arrival of the convoy, and again, we're just making sure that they have a common understanding of the situation. The other thing that we're doing is we're thinking a little bit about making sure that we're prepared in the event that things don't go as planned that weekend. Right? This is a scenario where -- that has been billed as a peaceful protest, a slow roll that will go through the Nation's Capital, and there's a series of activities on the Hill, and you know, in the park, a prayer service, and that those things will happen as intended. But in the back of our mind, we were also thinking about, you know, what if things don't go as planned? There's a lot about this situation that we don't. You know, it is -- it isn't like Canada Day, where law enforcement has, you know, it happens on the same day every year, there are weeks to prepare. We don't have perfect information about the situation as it's developing, we don't, like, have fidelity, for example, on how many trucks, how many individuals. You know, so we're thinking about that. And when you have large groups of people get together, you always need to be foreseeing the possibility that intentionally or otherwise, you know, it could lead to violence and loss of life, and so we're thinking about how do we make sure that the government would be ready and we could bring ministers together if something unfortunate happened over the weekend. And it wasn't a theoretically possibility. Like some of the statements that were being made in the lead-up to that weekend, you know, references to the January 6th attack on Capitol Hill, you know, we -- I think the Federal Public Service was well aware of the actual threat of lone actors that could take advantage of the situation. So that's kind of what's going through our mind. On one hand, making sure that everybody understands what's happening. We hope everything is going to go as planned, but we also need to be prepared if things don't transpire as they are presented. So to get to your question, which is about, you know, when did you know that things were... So I think it became clear to us on Sunday that things... I remember watching the news conference that was held by the organisers of the convoy, where it was made clear that they were staying. And so then we're starting to give some thought to, okay, Parliament is scheduled to return on the Monday, we -- you know, we're still in hybrid format, but we know some ministers are going to be making a decision to return to Ottawa, either flying in on the Sunday evening or the next day. We need -- you know, presumably the Prime Minister would like some information about whether it's safe and secure for them to do that, how will they access the Hill. We're also thinking about our own employees in the Federal Public Service. Our -- you know, whether that's at PCO or other employees, while we're in a remote work posture, there are still many, including in the security and intelligence sphere, that need to access our building, so we need to be thinking about their health and safety. So by that Sunday night, we would have been having meetings with the National Security Intelligence Advisor, and then ultimately with the Clerk, in order to brief her so that she would be in a position to brief the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister’s Office about the current situation, kind of leading into the week.",26-016-03,16,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

There’s not clear signs that the situation’s going to be resolved, or we don’t have confidence of any signs that it’s going to be resolved. We’re also starting to hear a lot of reports that, you know, there will be additional protest activity over the weekend, both in Ottawa and in Alberta, and so, you know, starting to be concerned that, you know, not only is this situation not resolving, but the situation could get worse.

26-021-09,"Okay. So this meeting, this is -- this is -- okay, maybe I’ll -- just for the benefit of others who won’t know, this is the -- this is a standing committee of Cabinet, it’s the Cabinet Committee on Safety, Security, and Emergencies. It has a threefold mandate. One, is to be concerned about threats and risks to the safety and security of Canada and Canadians. It has a second responsibility for management of ongoing emergencies; and, thirdly, to ensure that there’s proactive, integrated, forward- looking thinking around the -- our level of emergency preparedness and capacity to respond to emergency management. So that’s the intent and purpose of the Committee. It’s a standing committee that will meet on a fixed schedule but it also, like other Cabinet committees, has the ability to meet on an ad hoc basis. And that’s exactly what we would have done at this situation, is decided, okay, I think it’s time to bring together the -- and support a conversation amongst the, you know, standing Cabinet committee. And so the meeting would’ve proceeded in two ways, as you’ll see reflected in the minutes, asking, you know, key heads of different institutions to report on the situation; so the Commissioner of the RCMP, I think the Director of the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service also provided an update, probably Deputy Minister Rob Stewart. And the idea there, just like the Ministerial briefings is to give everybody a common understanding of this situation, how it’s evolving, what we know, what we don’t know. And then the second part of the discussion is to start to talk about -- a little bit more about what more the federal government might want to do to try to support the resolution of this situation. So you will see, I think in the minutes, there is a placemat that, you know, puts together a quick snapshot of some different range of options that the government could consider. And it wasn’t perfect, but it was there to kind of stimulate conversation on the range of options within federal jurisdiction of things that Ministers and departments might be able to think about.",26-021-11,21,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So you’re thinking about what authorities do you have; what influence do you have; what resources do you have; what are the kinds of things that you could do? So you see on the left-hand side of this document, the convening and engagement power that -- power; the convening and engagement sort of influence that the government could bring to bear. So, for example, is there more that we should be doing with provinces and jurisdiction -- provinces and territories that we’re not already doing? And that could be, you know, Ministers. Ministers at this point had already been doing some engagement. Should there be more? You know, should we be thinking about a call between the Prime Minister and Premiers, or anything; just thinking about all of those things. Engagement, you know, with the City of Ottawa, directly. Should we be doing more? And, you know, what form should that take?

Fortunately, those two jurisdictions learned a little bit about the experience in Ottawa and were able to manage those situations differently, and it didn't result in, you know, what we were seeing happen in Ottawa.

I think it's important to also maybe note that at the start of this week is we’d already seen some protest activity around the Ambassador Bridge, and now we’re in a situation where that, you know, is a much more dire situation. And so what we decided to do was add on an item at this meeting and again update Ministers and talk about what more might need to be done. And I think, you know, the situation is becoming increasingly concerning. You know, it’s getting worse, and not getting better. And we don’t have line of sight on how these different situations that exist are going to get resolved or get better quickly.

26-034-12,"That’s essentially what’s happening; right? Is we’ve had a conversation with the clerk amongst deputies that morning. We and our team are acting as a bit of an aggregator of information that is coming in from departments. We’re not writing a lot ourselves. We’re just pulling it in from departments. And the nature of the conversation that we had that morning was I think I would characterize it -- if you permit me to do that? Can I do that? To -- you know, is two things. So on the one hand, was it all of the range of things within existing federal authorities that can be brought to bear to resolve this situation? And you know, you’re looking at not just resolving the current situation, you’re also thinking about, you know, mitigating the situation getting worse; right? Because we do have a serious, you know, situation, and, you know, how do we prevent it from getting worse? So I think that the Commissioner and those who are listening today would have heard in other testimony that was given by other Deputy Minister’s this week some of the things that we talked about in that meeting that morning, the work that had been underway in getting that on paper. So the kinds of things I’m talking about are, for example, you know, first order of business is to think about what additional resources does law enforcement need? You know, whether that is people, or it’s equipment, or, you know, whatever it is that they need in order -- money, what is it, in order to be able to enforce the laws and address the situations that we’re seeing. You know, another example is engagement. You know, do we need to be doing more in terms of engagement with other orders of government, or engagement, for example, with the organizers of the protests and the demonstrations. So that’s, you know, a second line. And I think you maybe had heard that from Deputy Minister Stewart during his testimony earlier this week, that that was something that he had been working on. You know, the other examples of things that we were working on, you would have heard from Deputy Minister Keenan about the strategic enforcement strategy; right? How do we, you know, encourage people to consider taking their trucks and leaving? They’re engaging in illegal behaviour, how, you know, can we help in that way? The tow truck strategy, which I think gave everybody gray hair, just thinking of the millions of ways that we could try to resolve that situation. So that’s -- and there was other things in that bucket of things that we need to do within our existing authorities, like in the vein of thinking about how do we make sure this situation doesn’t become worse, one of the things that, for example, the President of the CBSA would have been worrying about is how do we harden or, what’s another way to say that, make more resilient our border points across the country? Like, you know, at this point in time, you know, at the SSE meeting on the 8th or, you know, as we’re having that discussion in the morning, he’s been reporting out on no less than 10 different, you know, border points being occupied. Ambassador Bridge is, for all pretense and purposes blocked, he’s having difficulty redirecting that critical traffic to Sarnia. Like, so we need to think about how do we make sure that this situation doesn’t get worse; right? Because these are critical supply lines, both in terms of Canadians, both in terms of trade, you know, and so we need to be thinking about that. So there, we’re kind of working on what are all the things that we can do within our existing authorities to try to support the resolution of this situation and not have it escalate or become worse.",26-034-14,34,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So thinking about, you know, what we had seen with Toronto and Quebec City, right, having learned the lessons of how to create the conditions for a peaceful protest, but not allow it to turn into an occupation or a blockade.

Like, if you saw in the document there was kind of a place holder for more information about the engagement proposal, and so this is what Deputy Minister Stewart was able to send to us the next day, to kind of be integrated into the package. And I think it -- I mean, he is better placed to discuss the contents of this, but I think it’s a reflection of, you know, where we were at that point in time. We had begun work on developing some advice on a potential path for engagement and had been doing that with police -- some advice from police experts.",26-052-21,52,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

26-053-07,"Certainly. That’s correct. I was involved in those calls. So my understanding, and I don’t have first hand knowledge of this part, but Deputy Minister Stewart obtained the name of Marcel Beaudin as an expert in PLTs and crowd psychology, those kinds of issues. And he -- Deputy Minister Stewart intended to speak with Supt. Beaudin and he called me and asked me if -- or texted. I can’t remember how he contacted me. But he asked me if I would be willing to participate. I said certainly. As Ms. Bodgen mentioned earlier, this was kind of an all hands on deck moment. If you were asked to help, you helped. So you heard Deputy Minister Stewart describe my role as observer. And he just wanted to ensure that PCO had line of sight on the conversations. So we had a phone call with Supt. Beaudin. I agree with Deputy Minister Stewart’s characterization that we learned quite a bit about PLTs and engagement and sort of the general approach. I think it was underscored that the utility of this kind of engagement at this point in time would be to see if we could shrink the footprint of the protests, much more so than looking for a resolution or a complete pathway to ending the protests in Ottawa. It was more about that intermediate step of shrinking the footprint. My recollection of the discussion is that there was quite a bit of focus on the idea of leadership. And I know when Supt. Beaudin testified earlier in the Inquiry he used the word “juice”. And that was a term he used in our phone calls both on the 10th and the 11th, “Who has the juice?” And by that, he meant we need to find the leaders that have the influence on the ground so that if they were to enter into any kind of arrangement, that there would be people that would follow them in the execution of that arrangement. My recollection was that while there may have been numbers of leaders thrown around, certainly on the first day that was very much a question of we’ll need to see, we’re still assessing. And then Deputy Minister Stewart started to put the ideas on paper, there was a second call with Supt. Beaudin. There was also a discussion about how to keep the different lanes clear. And I think that has been referred to so far in the Inquiry as matters of church and state. How do we ensure that the police are operating under their authority, how do we ensure that engagement that might happen by officials or even at a political level are coordinated but not interfering with the police authority? So there was certainly an attentiveness to the coordination element of how this could play out. And based on those conversations, Deputy Minister Stewart put together a piece of paper, which I know is in the minutes from a subsequent IRG meeting, he put together a proposal for consideration at the IRG. My understanding of our intent in those meetings was to essentially test the viability of a proposal. It was a proposal for engagement. What was the best possible proposal, I guess, that we could put forward that might have a chance of being accepted? So it was about doing the leg work on putting together a proposal and then putting that up to decision makers to consider.",26-053-09,53,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

26-057-07,"And if we scroll down a bit more?

Is that right?",26-057-09,57,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
26-057-13,"Certainly, yes, it is. That’s correct. So as you will flesh out in more detail with other witnesses, after the invocation of the Act, there was fairly careful monitoring of how measures were implemented and the impact they were having, the daily meetings that we had had before invocation continued. And as we went into that next weekend, the 20th, I think, was the Sunday, if memory serves, and the large police action in Ottawa had taken place and circumstances had evolved at other protest sites across the country, including ports of entry. Earlier in the day, the National Security and Intelligence Advisor had reached out to the Deputy community implicated and asked, you know, essentially, “What’s your assessment of where we’re at with the need for the Emergencies Act?” And after that step, she turned to me and said, “Can you put some ideas on paper?” Unlike invocation, my understanding of the Act is that it doesn’t have specific criteria or a test for revocation, and so we were looking to put together policy advice on when revocation was appropriate. We had been -- it had been part of our narrative for that week that the Emergencies Act would be utilized only as long as necessary; and there were several people who would add to that, not a minute longer. It was really very -- a strong message to us, “Not a minute longer.” And I think in that weekend, the people who really do, as Ms. Bogden described, the PCO role, they’re really charged with looking ahead, what’s coming, what’s the next step? They knew that we needed to have the criteria in place. My first draft I would characterize as pretty rough. You can see some of my thinking there, which was influenced by some of the conversations I had earlier that day, that what we didn’t want to do was keep the Orders in place long enough that the emergency, the crisis started to recede, but then revoke the Orders at just the moment when everything could go back to the way it was, or worse. So you see my reflections on, you know, even if trucks have left downtown Ottawa, are they still positioned to come back? We didn’t want to be in a position of having things re-establish quickly. We -- so that kind of influenced the thinking, and the other thing I was trying to sort of think through was, you know, the Orders themselves; how would you assess that they had served their purpose? In this email exchange that you have pulled up, you see some back and forth with some Deputy Ministers, and Deputy Mike Keenan in particular used some language about, “Okay, these factors may be indicators of the sort of things we’re looking at but what this really comes down to is; is it necessary? Is it still necessary?” And the way I understood that language and the way I tried to use it from that point was you have to understand your threat level and then you have to understand whether that threat is manageable within the existing authorities, meaning outside of the Emergencies Act, or whether you still need the leverage of the Emergencies Act to address the threat that you’ve assessed. So it became two points, with some indicators that followed to help people think through the two points, but those two points became sort of the focus of how the advice evolved from that point.",26-057-15,57,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MR. JEFFERY HUTCHINSON,jeffery hutchinson
26-059-16,"Okay. So essentially this is -- it’s starting from first principles, almost, because there are no criteria that you’re working with. How do we put together the criteria. And the attempt, as I understand it, is to find that sweet spot between the -- being confident that it’s not too early and the emergencies won’t recur, and revoking at the earliest minute possible.",26-059-18,59,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So these are the Chief Justice’s reasons. And Mr. Clerk, if you could go to page 8, please, paragraph 47. And you’ll see here that the Chief Justice heard evidence and made findings with respect to the efforts to hold the bridge open and the risk that the blockade would be re- established. And I do want to take some time to take a look at the Chief Justice’s findings here. So the Chief Justice found that: “…the City has established a strong prima facie case, on a balance of probabilities, that the protesters have breached multiple municipal by-laws and that there is a risk they will continue to do so based on the following uncontroverted evidence:…” And you’ll see -- I won’t read it all out, but you will see that there’s a number of subpoints here, but the Chief Justice found that: ”…the protestors continued to breach multiple municipal by-laws, as [was] evidenced by multiple tickets issued for by-law infractions…” He found that: “There is evidence of the protesters’ expressed intent to continue their blockade despite the February 11 Order.” Found that” “There [was] evidence that the protesters plan to continue to protest on roadways approaching the Bridge.” And cites some evidence that the police provided, the Windsor Police provided, who were monitoring social media: “…including messages of ‘it’s not over,’ ‘we are not done’ and ‘Civil war time.” And: “As a result of the continued threat of a new blockade, police continue[d] to control traffic flow onto Huron Church Road [which we’ve heard is a municipal roadway] to protect access to the Bridge.” So the Chief Justice made these findings and found that: “The evidence clearly establishe[d] that […] the protestors chose to ignore [the Order] and continue[d] to impede and obstruct access to the Bridge [after the Order was granted].” So were you aware of these findings at the time?",26-083-11,83,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

We’ve also been having some discussion during this hearing about the distinction between lawful and unlawful protests, and I just wanted to show you page 10, paragraph 59. And you’ll see here the Chief Justice refers to the rule of law and states that: “The rule of law requires that everyone obey the law. Significant, organized, deliberate and persistent defiance of the law and court orders is a serious threat to the rule of law which is one of the foundations of a functioning democracy. The protesters are obliged, as is every Canadian citizen, to follow the law and not breach municipal by-laws or court orders that prohibit unlawful conduct…” So, you know, I wanted to -- I’m not sure if you have any comments on that, or if you were asked any questions about the distinction between lawful and unlawful protests, but again, the Chief Justice did make findings that the protests were unlawful in Windsor.",26-085-12,85,12,10,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And our perception of emergency legislation is as much about what are the tools to help and what enables help as -- that’s kind of our focus more than anything else. I was pretty struck during the summer when the U.K. could declare a national emergency over heat and take steps to protect their citizens under national legislation and, to my knowledge, and I’m learning on the job, as Deputy Stewart referred to the other day, to my knowledge, we don’t have that kind of framework. We’ve a little bit more of a patchwork. Now, you can say that that’s due to confederation versus a unitary system of government, but I do think that there’s room. And I think that I would take it one step further and say that if we could strengthen the tools and the frameworks around protecting critical infrastructure, we could actually -- by doing that, we’d be protecting the space for legal and safe demonstration in our democracy because the rules would be clearer and the protection of what impacts people the most would be well protected.",26-086-24,86,24,22,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

I think, you know, as representing the City of Windsor, I think we’ve seen, and if you’ll agree with me, that these protests in January and February have also emphasized the need for collaboration with the local authorities and the first responders who are responding to these on the ground. And as you’re aware, municipalities respond to the vast majority of emergencies in Canada.

And evidence throughout this Inquiry has talked about how unique this situation was, but then the conversation has tended, with all due respect, has tended to be about specific locations. I think on the 12th or 13th, stepping back and looking at it nationally, it continued to be a unique situation with a lot of tools in play, but not a sense of resolution to the threat, the continued, particularly, in my way of thinking, particularly around the economic threat, which I understand would be a threat to property.",26-096-24,96,24,22,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

And you know, here, this reference to, ""Police say protesters overwhelmed officers"", you know, that's also the point I made earlier, you know, what we were seeing in B.C. and Coutts.

And in that case, that’s a Public Order situation and law enforcement would deal with the first line of response to that, but it’s happening in the nation’s capital. There might be a need for, you know, a government or several government Ministers to say something about that, and so just thinking about if that situation materializes, who’s on first, who’s on second, is everybody clear about roles and responsibilities, how would we get Ministers together. Now, there’s a theoretical risk that it could be worse than that, but we just need to know what the machinery is and what we would do and, you know, kind of what happens in the first four hours, first 12 hours, and that’s the kinds of things that you’re thinking about.",26-109-03,109,3,2,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

26-115-04,"I wrote the words, “Slow down” just so that I would try to remember that. Thank you, Commissioner. So the Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet is the full title of the position. And I would say that that basically encompasses three roles. The Privy Council Office is the department of the Prime Minister. And so I serve as the Deputy Minister of the Privy Council Office, and the Deputy Minister, therefore, to the Prime Minister. I am the most Senior Public Service Advisor to the Prime Minister and to his Office. I’m responsible for the overall management of the Privy Council Office, and the discharge of all of our functions and responsibilities. And making sure that -- so that’s kind of the administration side, but I’m also the advisor on all matters that would before -- be before the Prime Minister for his consideration and decision. Second part of the role is the Secretary to the Cabinet. And in that respect, I’m responsible for helping to organize Cabinet meetings, make sure that the agendas are set, the attendance is set, the information is available for Ministers to deliberate on; that the meetings are supported with things like translation, all of the kind of staff support; that the decisions of the Cabinet are faithfully recorded and therefore comm -- and communicated out as necessary. And I’m responsible for overseeing the implementation, then, of those decisions. So anything to do with how Cabinet operates its decision-making structure, I am responsible for. Obviously working with the team in the Privy Council Office, both in the advisory function and the Secretary to the Cabinet function. And then, finally, in our system, the head of the -- the Clerk of the Privy Council has a third role, which is the Head of the Public Service. And I think if you look at the Institutional Summary for the Privy Council Office, we try to describe that in the Canadian’s version of the Westminster System, the Public Service is a professional, non-partisan Public Service. And I am responsible, as the Head of the Public Service, for, amongst other things, providing an annual report to the Prime Minister on the state of the Public Service. In this respect, I also provide advice to the Prime Minister on the appointment and performance of Deputy Ministers and other senior officials. And, basically, for making sure that the Public Service is ready to be able to serve the needs of the government and of the country, today, and also a stewardship role into the future. So those are kind of the three roles. And I would say the other thing that might be relevant as we get into this conversation is the Clerk of the Privy Council is one of a community of Deputy Ministers. I think in -- the expression would be primus inter pares, you have -- you are one amongst others, and I very much work with the community of Deputies, in order to be able to discharge those functions.",26-115-06,115,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
26-119-15,"Sure. I think the term that Madam Drouin used of organic maybe applies here. There are many, many routes in terms of the flow of information and advice between myself and the team in the Privy Council Office and the Prime Minister’s office and the team that support him there. When it comes to the Prime Minister himself, it gets more structured. And I’ll come back to that in a moment. There would be daily conversations going on between PMO and PCO staff, whether it’s around information exchange, trying to think about how to manage an issue, surface a problem we’re trying to solve, exchange information. Any number of things in the course of a day would take place. In terms of the advice to the Prime Minister, when it comes to the exchange of information with the Prime Minister, in some cases you will see, I think even in evidence, of documents that have been submitted to the Commission that if it’s for the purposes of just sheer information, you would see a briefing note perhaps prepared by one of the Deputy Secretaries to the Cabinet. But if it contains advice, it contains a recommendation, if write to the Prime Minister for the purpose of decision, that would come through me. In some cases, some of those briefing notes may also go through Madam Drouin, and if I’m not around, Madam Drouin can sign off on briefing notes, decision notes for my -- over my signature.",26-119-17,119,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

26-120-15,"I think that would be fair to say, yes. As well, we have a number of opportunities to provide oral information, oral briefings to the Prime Minister as well. I have a regular bilateral meeting with him every week, which is joined by the Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister. That is Katie Telford. And sometimes other members of the Prime Minister’s staff will join us. And that’s a session where sometimes the Prime Minister has items, I might have items, the Prime Minister’s Office may have items. But what’s kind of our regular once a week touch base, traffic management, advisory, decision, kind of -- whatever is on the issue plate of the day. Every second week, the Deputy Prime Minister will be joining into that meeting as well. So that’s our regular structure. We may have issue-based meetings or briefings with the Prime Minister. We’ve done -- for a very long time, we were doing frequent, three times a week briefings of the Prime Minister and his office, sometimes with Ministers on the covid situation, for example. That might involve senior officials from other departments, Dr. Theresa Tam, the Chief Public Officer, officials from Public Health Agency and Health, and so on and so on. You get the picture. When there is a Cabinet meeting that the Prime Minister is involved in, we almost always have a pre-brief session with the Prime Minister where we’ll go over the agenda, the kind of show, who is going to say what, the key issues to be deliberated, so he has a focus on, in addition to the written briefing material we would have provided, kind of what are the key issues he's trying to adjudicate at the session, what are some of the perspectives he may want to be listening for, where is the area or the zone for a possible decision. And we would be doing that before a Cabinet meeting, for instance. And certainly, I think which will be relevant to the work of the Commission, before an Incident Response.",26-120-17,120,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS.

But just picking up on the last point that you made in terms of the communication lines and briefings, could you set the stage for us in terms of what was going on in government at the time? At a very practical level, as well as a sort of ideas level. So were things happening virtually? Where were people working? Where were you? Where was the Prime Minister? That scene.",26-121-25,121,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
26-122-06,"Right. So to cast your mind back, we were in January of 2022. We -- the country, like many other countries around the world, was dealing with the Omicron variant of covid. We actually had, I believe in mid- January, record levels of hospitalizations, even higher than previous peaks of the covid outbreak. And so the vast majority of the public service was working remotely, although there were some people, but dint of their function who had the need to come into the office to access secure materials or so on. But it was kind of -- the public health advice was to be working remote by default, and that’s where the bulk of the public service was. The same thing for, I think it’s fair to say, for the Prime Minister, Ministers, and political staff. So we were all working remotely. I remember this well because there was a Cabinet retreat that was held in the week of, I have a little calendar here to try to remind me of dates, the week of January the 24th. That would have been the first Cabinet retreat that had taken place since the Government was formed after the 2021 election. And I think everybody was hoping that that was going to be an opportunity for a face to face, and unfortunately it ended up being a virtual. We are very fortunate to have secure video communications so we can actually have Cabinet meetings held virtually, and so we were able to do that in the week. There was a lot of other issues that were before the Government. I think you would have heard from other witnesses as well that we were monitoring the potential for an emerging situation in Ukraine and trying to prepare for what possibly could happen at that point in time. And so as we came out of the -- came out -- the Cabinet retreat, I believe, was two or three days, and that’s when we started to hear the early signals that there might be a protest or a series of protests happening in Ottawa, and potentially other locations. Now, I should say that as of January the 15th, there was a change in the public health measures related to covid that affected truckers in the country, affected cross- border traffic, and that change was for truckers that were unvaccinated coming back into the country. They were -- they had been previously exempt and they were now going to be subject to public health measures. And so we were monitoring very closely both the implementation of that measure, as well as the talking to the trucking association and monitoring, because it was clear that at that point in time, despite the very serious record levels of covid we were facing, that Canadians were kind of getting a bit fed up at that point in time with the restrictions, and the measures, and what they were having to deal with. And so that was very much on our minds. We were getting ready for the return of the House of Commons. They had been on a Parliamentary break coming out of the holiday season and the House was due to resume on the 31st of January. And so as we went into what I think others have described as Weekend 1, the weekend starting Friday, the 28th of January, we were monitoring and waiting for the protest that we had understood was going to be arriving. And that’s kind of the context at the very beginning, if that’s helpful.",26-122-08,122,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. JANICE CHARETTE,janice charette

26-124-16,"The first briefing I had with the Prime Minister was an oral briefing on the 30th of January. I think you’ve heard testimony from other Privy Council Office colleagues that there were PCO/PMO briefings that had been going on in week before that there had been daily Ministerial briefings going on starting, I think, on the Thursday before that. So on the Sunday, the 30th, there was a telephone call or oral briefing with the Prime Minister, including members of his staff, other members of the Privy Council Office to basically kind of give him a situation report. At that point in time, it was Sunday, I believe it was evening, and it was pretty clear that the protestors weren’t leaving. So we had a situation in Ottawa and our thoughts were turning immediately to the House return the next day and whether there was any issues we had to be thinking our way through in terms of the safe conduct of Parliamentarians actually accessing the Parliament buildings. As you may recall, Wellington Street was a bit of a challenging area. As the head of the Public Service and responsible for our department, I also had to think about what instructions we were giving to public servants, some of whom were still required to be going into the office about whether we were closing buildings or leaving those open. So that was really the first briefing with the Prime Minister, kind of a situation report, what was happening, giving him information. We were able to tell him that there had been Ministerial briefings, that there was lots of outreach going on by Deputy Ministers across we call it the Town, across Ottawa, across departments and agencies. And so that was -- and I wouldn’t say that we sought any decisions from him at that point in time other than to have a conversation about were we well connected, for example, were the right people talking to Parliamentary officials, to the Sergeant at Arms, the Parliamentary Protective Service. Were they connected up to the -- to law enforcement and security agencies to make sure that, you know, Parliament at the centre of our democracy could function well starting the next day.",26-124-18,124,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So I was trying to get a sense -- that was at the end of weekend 2 -- trying to get a sense from Ministers and from my colleagues kind of what the situation was and what the sense was about how this was all going. I got a readout, a debrief, from the Cabinet Committee meeting on the 8th of February from my colleagues who were there, and it was certainly clear to me that the level of concern, anxiety and the situation itself was escalating. And so that was the reason I chose to go to the DMOC meeting on the 9th and to hear out my colleagues in terms of -- and to give direction at that point in time. And it was through the course of that day listening to them and other meetings that took place during that day I’m happy to tell you about if you’d like that I formed the view as we went into the 10th that it was time for me to provide the advice for the Prime Minister to decide to -- as to whether or not he wanted to convene an Incident Response Group meeting.",26-128-15,128,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Then “Public safety. Feels organized. Ambassador Bridge stretches. OPP incremental success, OPS. Working in incremental way”. And then if we just scroll down a little bit more to what I’m actually looking for. “Clerk. We need to take this over.

26-131-03,"--- it would have been in the context of a broader meeting. It looks like, from what you have heard, that if PS is, in fact, the Public Safety, there was others there as well. Let’s talk about what the meeting was about. So having heard the readout from the SSE meeting on the 8th -- I should add as well there was a debate in the House of Commons on the 7th of February, if I’m not wrong, on the convoy situation. Parliamentarians, House of Commons, Member of Parliament can trigger a debate if they wish, and I gather the Speaker consented to that and so there was a debate. So there was rising levels of concern. That was obvious. And we heard this from the SSE Committee as well, and so I went to the DMOC meeting which was taking place at 8 o’clock in the morning on the 9th. And my purpose there was really to do a couple of things. I was there to make sure that I was hearing firsthand from Deputy Ministers and agency heads who have responsibilities in this area who had been meeting with the National Security Intelligence Advisor through the days previous to that on their assessment of the situation, and I wanted to provide my direction to them as the senior public servants, that in my view this was a very serious situation, that we had rising levels of questions from federal ministers, who were asking ""How is this going to end? What can we do?"" And so my commentary at the meeting, I think I was at two DMOCs on this day, as a matter of fact. Certainly at the first meeting at -- in the morning, my objective, my intention was to try to say to my Deputy Minister colleagues, ""We have to leave no stone unturned. We have to make sure that we are looking at every power, duty, every authority we have, every resource we have to make we are bringing the full power of the Federal Government and its resources to try to help those who are frontline responsible to manage the situation."" I'm not an expert in any of these domains. I would be conveying, like, ""we've got to get on this, and we've got to use"", like this -- I think you heard the expression this morning, you know, this is an ""all hands on deck"". I don't know why we use naval references, but all hands on deck situation. And I would've been saying all hands on deck. No idea too crazy. Let's look at absolutely everything. Let's look at every law we have, every resource we have. And including in that, what would it mean, you know, how does law enforcement actually -- well, like, how do the structures work? Who is responsible for what? You know, if it gets beyond the capability of one particular, you know, like a local police force, like the Ottawa Police Service or the RCMP acting in its local capacity, say in Coutts, you know, what happens then? Where does it go from there? Who takes over from that? How does that all work? How does the jurisdiction work? What are the responsibilities work? So this is not a -- my direction to the sense there was any direction was to let's get on this work. We need to get this work done. I think you heard a lot from Ms. Bogden this morning about then what she was doing the whole day long to try and collect up this information. But that would have been my intention. I didn't tell people what to do, I was asking -- we've got to get this work done.",26-131-05,131,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. JANICE CHARETTE,janice charette

You were looking at the coverage in the media. You were seeing the Parliament buildings behind it. So there was a lot of questions being asked of federal ministers, ""What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?"" And so certainly, we had the sense coming out of the meeting on the 8th they were impatient to know what they could do, and that was my direction to the town at this meeting is go and figure this out.

That's something she sent off a draft of some point during the -- on the 9th, and think at three o'clock in the morning on the 10th. So we've looked at that. And you mentioned, I'm just going to take you back to your conclusion before, that at some point in all of this you formed the conclusion or gave the advice to the Prime Minister that it was time to convene an Incident Response Group.",26-134-09,134,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

26-134-22,"So perhaps I can say in addition to that meeting with Deputy Ministers there was another meeting with deputies later in the day. I think if you -- you'll hear from the Prime Minister and ministers next week, but in addition to what the Public Service was doing, and outside of these official kind of Cabinet committee meetings and daily ministerial briefings, the Prime Minister was also speaking to his ministers, either one at a time or in small groups, in more informal conversations, getting his own direct kind of ""What's happening? Brief me on this."" talking to his own team. He'd been talking to mayors, he'd been talking to other stakeholders. And through the day on the 9th, as he was talking to his ministers, a number of which those interactions I was party to, I'm not always, but a number of those, certainly conversations with the Minister of Public Safety, Minister Mendocino and the Minister of Emergency Management, Preparedness Management, I can never remember, Minister Blair, you could feel that, you know, we were moving to a -- it felt to me like we were moving to a place that we had to be ready in case ministers and the Prime Minister actually wanted to look at what our options to be able to act. And so as the day turned over from nine to ten, I certainly formed the view that I believed it was time for the Prime Minister to convene the Incident Response Group. There was another informal call amongst Prime Minister and ministers that morning, and after that I gave my advice, and the Prime Minister accepted it and chose to have a meeting, an in-person meeting, which was unusual at the time because of course we were still working remotely, but given the stakes of what we were talking about and the nature of the situation we were dealing with, my advice was I thought it would be important to have an in-person meeting, and we did that at an offsite.",26-134-24,134,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

It was also the federal vaccine mandate. So all the indicators were towards it is, you know, the Federal Government is owning the situation, and yet on the ground, RCMP, for example, didn't have jurisdiction on Wellington Street. We don't have jurisdiction on routes that brings you to the bridge. So it feels that we owned it publicly, but we didn't have jurisdiction to address the situation.

26-139-04,"Okay, I’m happy to do that. So the Incident Response Group is a committee of cabinet. It is usually chaired by the prime minister. Although it can happen without the prime minister, these ones did not. They were all chaired by the prime minister. They include a collection of ministers that are necessary to deal with either a national crisis, an emergency. That could happen in Canada; it could happen outside of Canada but affect either Canadian interests or Canadians. And so I think you did hear testimony this morning, perhaps, from Mr. Hutchinson that the IRGs have been used, for example, with wildfires in British Columbia, for dealing with Hurricane Fiona in Atlantic Canada. It was also used, subsequently, to deal with the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and dealing with Canadian interests and Canadians as a result of that. So it could be a crisis that emerges domestically that affects Canada or a Canadian crisis. It is unlike other cabinet committees, and I think you did talk about this a bit this morning with Ms. Bogden. Cabinet -- the structure of cabinet is cabinet is the decision-making structure. Cabinet committees make recommendations which are ultimately ratified by cabinet. So it's kind of the -- the work gets divvied up amongst cabinet ministers. There’s -- because there’s a lot of decisions that get taken, kind of more thorough deliberation, and then they come to cabinet for final deliberation and decision-making. The Incident Response Group, the IRG, is unlike those other cabinet committees.

26-141-21,"So I’ll start, perhaps, and then you can add if you want, Madam. So this goes back to the kind of -- Track 1/Track 2 goes back to the conclusions of the IRG meeting on the 10th of February where the prime minister heard from a variety of senior officials on what the situation, their kind of overview of the situation, the treat and risk assessment the NSIA, from agency heads; then he turned to his ministers for their view of the situation, who they’d been speaking to, what was happening, what they thought needed to be done. And coming out of the meeting on the 10th, in the way the conclusions of the meeting and the tasking coming out of that meeting was, there was two tracks of work to be done. Track 1 was everything that could be done within existing authorities, existing jurisdiction; although it may take new resources to do those things, what’s everything that we could do within the existing set of powers, duties, and functions under law? And then Track 2 was, are there new instruments that we might need; are there new legal authorities that we might need? So this looks to me like what we would have tabled -- I think this is true -- this is what we would have tables as a supporting document, an input to the deliberations of the IRG as the results of what had -- the work that had been done since the meeting on the 10th. And so it goes item by item and it describes, well, what was -- what were we doing under Item 1, and a bit more description of it; who was the lead on that, if any supporting departments; what the status of it was; if there were any documents. And if you go to number 3, you’ll see that there are some supporting documents and any other notes. So we were able to, on an ongoing basis, be in a position to provide ministers with an update on all the work that was underway across all the departments across both Track 1 and Track 2.",26-141-23,141,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Is there anything you’d like to -- well, I suppose you didn’t necessarily hear all of the NSIA’s evidence but she spoke at some length of the social media intelligence gap and the difficulty of the federal government in collecting the kind of information that may have been of assistance in this situation. Is that something you’ve personally observed as well? Would that apply to you as well?",26-143-30,143,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
26-144-14,"I would say that, again, context matters here. We were the 12th of February and as this track was being put together, we had a situation that was moving very quickly. There was a lot of inputs of information. We had very organized ways to get information through some of the agencies and a lot of that fed in through the National Security Intelligence Advisor, through organizations like the Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre which operates as part of CSIS. What it felt to us at the time -- and I think, as the time went on, we both found out some things that told us we didn’t have a gap -- some people knew things, it’s just we didn’t have necessarily a way of sharing all the information. So I would say as you read here, the intelligence gap, and it goes on to specify open source, non-criminal, non-terrorist. So we thought we had -- we knew law enforcement was collecting up intelligence, wasn’t necessarily sharing it with us, nor necessarily should they have, because it was operational information. Terrorists, that would have been specific agencies that were collecting that. But it fell to us when it came to open source and that there were things happening, particularly in the offline space and through earned media that perhaps we didn’t really have a full 360-degree view on. And I would comment here that one of my observations is that on the public service side, we don’t tend to be as skilled and as literate -- I'm making a huge generalization here, but stick with me -- we don’t tend to be as skilled or as literate in the use of social media as the team that supports ministers and the prime minister on the political side. That’s very much kind of in their wheelhouse and we don’t tend to do as much of that. And so even going back before convoys and back to kind of through the election and afterwards, I was -- I would find myself on occasion hearing the prime minister's office staff, Ms. Telford and others, talking about things that they were seeing on social media that I just -- I wasn’t seeing and I wasn’t necessarily hearing or picking up. Those wouldn't have been the same places I would get information. They wouldn’t be the normal kind of inputs that I would receive. And so as we sat -- and this is one of the interesting things about the Incident Response Group -- unlike other Cabinet committees, ministers, the prime minister at the table, but senior officials are also at the table able to participate in the conversation. Normally in Cabinet or Cabinet committees, officials are there and we're called on to speak. We don’t kind of participate in the conversation. But given the situation we were faced with, everybody was kind of trying to workshop this together. What could we do? And it became clear in the conversation, which is why you see this in the tracker, that there were -- there was things happening in the open source, in the social media environment that we just didn’t have a very good handle on. And so that was one of the things, like, how could we close that gap? How could we figure that out better? And I think you see products later that we have attempted to actually try to figure this out.",26-144-16,144,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS.

Track 2, you see that the first sort of item there is ""Assess utility of other tools that do not require invoking the Emergencies Act, e.g., the National Defence Act."" Now, I appreciate that the rest of that is solicitor-client privilege which is redacted, but is it fair to day that there were options other than the Emergencies Act being considered in some ways?",26-146-17,146,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

You may have heard some of that yesterday from the Department of Finance, Mr. Sabia, and the Department of Finance colleagues, or the Emergency Act, which is really a legislation of last resort. So were there other things that could be done, other legislative steps that could have been taken? That’s -- but I'd say that we were trying to do this not so much inventing legislation but trying to understand the nature of the gaps and therefore, what would be the solutions to try to fill those gaps as opposed to kind of think up, you know, new legislative solutions on the spot.",26-146-28,146,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So we develop a little bit better understanding on how it operates, what is the oversight mechanisms, the House, the Joint Committee, this Inquiry, the consultation with the PT, so all the necessary steps to invoke. So this is where I think we develop a little bit more agility with the Act. But coming back to the convoy, from my perspective, the real first time where we start thinking about that was really after the DMOC of February 9 when, you know, as a group, we said we need to look at all potential options. And this is why we -- sorry, we start looking at what kind of tools the Emergency Act can give us, how we -- you know, meeting the thresholds of the Emergency Act.

26-151-14,"It was a Sunday. That’s right. Also Day 17, at the end of the third weekend. I think you’ve heard testimony from other colleagues and others about kind of what was going on in terms of the protests, what was happening at -- we had all been, when we weren’t working and on calls, we’d been watching the law enforcement action that had been taking place in Windsor for example. We were watching what was happening on our television screens. But there were calls and meetings that took place that day, which are the focus, I believe, of your question. I don’t recall myself participating in a DMOC that day. I may have. I just can’t remember, to be honest with you. My focus was really on getting ready for the IRG meeting at that point, just given the escalation that had taken place, the fact that we were in -- we were at -- we were coming to the end of the third weekend. I think the IRG was in the afternoon on the 13th, if I recall correctly. So we were getting ready for that, making sure the materials were ready and so on, collecting up all of the latest inputs. We were at the end of the third weekend. Ottawa was still a significant site of what I think was generally considered at that point to be an illegal protest. There -- make no mistake, there were people who were there for a lawful protest, but at that point, the totality of the situation in Ottawa was an illegal protest, an illegal blockade. And what was going on in Windsor. And we saw the size of the effort that was required to bring Windsor under control and the duration of the effort. That took days to de-escalate and to eliminate -- to get to a point where that situation was settled and the port of entry was able to open, but we didn’t know how long it was going to be sustained. So all to say, it was a series set of circumstances. Other ports of entry were kind of on and off. The situation was quite volatile. So at any point in time, there were lots of different inputs. We went into the Incident Response Group in the afternoon of the 13th of February and through conversations that we had had internally, my -- the proposed agenda for the IRG was a bit different than it was on the 10th or the 12th. And if you look carefully at it, you’ll see that we have switched the order of items. The first item is not what you would normally expect as a situational overview and update. Ministers and the Prime Minister had been meeting on the 12th, they’d been meeting on the 10th, they’d been getting this constant feed of information. So the advice of the Prime Minister was to turn, at that point, immediately to -- given we were at the end of the third weekend, we still had a very challenging and I believe the conclusions we had were a dangerous situation, a complex, volatile situation. What were the options. What were the decisions available to Ministers? And then after a long series of deliberations, then there was, is there anything new to add? And so an upside-down flip of the traditional agenda. And the conclusion coming out of that Incident Response Group was the Prime Minister was convening the Cabinet on the evening of the 13th of February, a virtual Cabinet call, luckily we had that secure video capacity to do that, to consult with his Cabinet on the overall response. And at that point, I think I’m allowed to say, of course, including the invocation of the Emergency Act as one of the decisions, the potential decisions to be considered by Cabinet.",26-151-16,151,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

26-156-06,"--- these notes are. And I will tell you for a fact that one of the things that’s written here is not accurate, because at 10:00 o’clock in the morning on the 14th, no decision had been taken about enacting the Emergency Measures Act, which is not the name of the legislation anyways. So with that out of the way, what happened at the IRG and the Cabinet meeting in terms of the materials, the inputs to the deliberations before the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, I think is the essence of your question. And so I would differentiate between how IRGs work and Cabinet. I think I said this a bit earlier. An IRG meeting, it’s really kind of everybody around the table trying to provide a contribution with the Prime Minister in the chair kind of deciding who gets to speak what and running the meeting, as you would expect. And so that’s a bit more of an opportunity for senior officials, including the RCMP Commissioner, to contribute. Whereas Cabinet is a different kind of a meeting. It’s a more structured formal meeting. The Prime Minister runs it. It’s tradition that Ministers speak and officials only speak if they’re called on by the Prime Minister. So a couple of things about this. Commissioner Lucki was a participant in the IRG and she was an attendee, I would say, at Cabinet. She was a participant, as I was a participant, at the IRG. And then an attendee and a secretary at the Cabinet meeting. I think it’s fair to say on the evening of the 13th when these two meetings took place that we had been hearing various versions of the evolution of a plan for the situation in Ottawa, as we had been hearing about law -- at a very high level, not at a detailed tactical or operational level, about the planning around what to do about Coutts, what to do about the situation at Emerson, what to do about the situation at Windsor. And so we’d been hearing about the evolution of the Ottawa plan. We’d been hearing about the conversation around the setting up of an Integrated Command Centre, so that RCMP and OPP resources, along with OPS resources, could be organized and share information and so on. But we’d heard a lot -- we’d heard often about a plan. What we hadn’t seen at the end of the third weekend was anything happening on the plan. And so the plan, which there had been various conversations about the Ottawa plan, there was no -- to the best of my recollection, the Commissioner or did not speak in detail at the IRG about the operational plan, but there were conversations about the fact that police were working together to have a plan, to resolve the situation in Ottawa, as you would expect them to. We had a horrific situation in Ottawa going on. You would expect that law enforcement at all levels were trying to figure out what to do about it. When it came to Cabinet, as I said, it's a different structure. The National Security and Intelligence Advisor provided an integrated brief to the Cabinet, which takes as inputs information that is provided through the colleagues who would be represented, for example, on the DMOC. And that would include the information that would have been fed in by the RCMP, by Transport, by CBSA, by CSIS, by PCO, by Global Affairs across -- again, and then the National Security Intelligence Advisor would provide that integrated view. The RCMP Commissioner, as any agency had a Deputy Minister, as a Minister who's also a member of the Cabinet, and we have obligations as Deputies to make sure when our Ministers are going to a Cabinet meeting, they're briefed, and they have our perspectives. And so my expectation would have been she would have also been briefing her Minister, Minister Mendocino, if she had things that she thought were relevant to the conversation. And so there was no explicit conversation either at the IRG, to the best of my memory, in detail about the plan but there had been many conversations leading up to that, as well as at the Cabinet meeting would have been the integrated view from the National Security Advisor, which has been the practice, I would say, without getting beyond the Cabinet confidence waiver that you have from the Prime Minister. It's fair to say that that has been the practice on other issues on which the Cabinet has been confronted. Situation in Ukraine, for example, the NSIA, the National Security Intelligence Advisor provides an integrated brief to the Cabinet pulling together all the information, so part of it's time management and one integrated brief. I guess the last thing I would say is that Commissioner Lucki, as the head of the RCMP, I recognized as the Clerk of the Privy Council that as the person who was in charge of the RCMP, there might be times when the RCMP Commissioner may have information that she did not want to provide in front of a large room of people, whether that's Ministers or officials, for whatever reason. There's sensitive information. And so I think it's part of my responsibility to make sure the RCMP Commissioner knows that if there's anything that she thinks that I need to know, that she has an open door to me. And also, that if she thought the Prime Minister needed information, that I would facilitate that. And I don't know whether there -- you know, I don't think there's any case in which the RCMP Commissioner has reached out to me to provide information that I have not had a chance to have that engagement with her. So we'll come to the conversation about what would have changed, if anything, if we'd known about it, in my view, just to give you the kind of the Cole's notes version of where we're going, it was one factor, one site, one moment in a complex situation.",26-156-08,156,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

26-162-01,"I think in the conversation around the management of the situation including the invocation of the Emergency Act, it's fair to say that Cabinet was briefed that there were tools and authorities in many organizations that had not been fully deployed, including in the RCMP. Think about the situation facing law enforcement on this third weekend. You know, they'd just been through the situation in the RCMP, along with OPP and Windsor Police Service, managing a significant situation in Windsor. They had this very difficult situation in front of them in Ottawa. RCMP was managing Coutts. There was a lot on the plate of law enforcement. It's a very difficult job at the best of times and these were not the best of times and very difficult conditions. And so that our police said that there were existing authorities -- we knew that there were existing authorities that hadn't been fully used. There were trucks parked on Wellington Street. You don't get to park on Wellington Street. So there were authorities that had not been fully deployed. There -- from municipal all the way through to Criminal Code, as the Commissioner indicates here. You would expect that the police were continuing to look at every available tool that they had to be able to deal with the situation. And so I can tell you that, to the best of my memory and my recollection, Cabinet were informed that, yes, there were tools and authorities. Track 1, go back to the tracker, there were Track 1 that hadn't been fully deployed, but the question was whether or not they were going to be adequate to be able to deal with the totality of the situation.

Sometime between the evening of the 6th and the morning of the 7th my colleagues in the Intergovernmental Affairs team and the Privy Council Office which is led by Deputy Minister Michael Vandergrift would have sent a message out to the offices of provincial and territorial leaders that the Prime Minister was convening a teleconference of provincial and territorial leaders. I think it was taking place at 10 o'clock in the morning which is a little bit early if you're in British Columbia, I suspect. But the objective was -- I’m not even sure that the subject matter was communicated. I think it was an FPT conference call.

26-168-19,"Okay. Another action- packed day. So my notes remind me that there was the First Ministers meeting. There was an Incident Response Group meeting, again on the 14th. The Privy Council Office was busy working, following the First Ministers meeting to pull together a decision note for the Prime Minister in terms of whether or not to actually proceed to invoke the Emergency Act. That all culminated in the mid-afternoon sometime after three o’clock, so collecting up inputs to be able to pull that together. And then the Prime Minister and I believe other ministers together made a public announcement that they were proceeding to invoke the Emergency Act. Meanwhile, kind of in the situation that was still evolving, that morning we had seen the RCMP taking action in Coutts, Alberta, the port of entry at the southern of Alberta. Coutts has never been so famous. We had been advised by the Commissioner of the RCMP at IRG meetings previous to that that without getting into detail, there was reason to believe that there were weapons at Coutts. But when -- after the First Ministers meeting and before the invocation, my decision note to the Prime Minister were finalized. Actually, it might have been even before the IRG, before the FMM. We were seeing the results of the law enforcement activity and what was happening at Coutts and we were seeing the size of the stash of firearms and ammunition that were found in Coutts amongst the protesters. So this was new and I would say relevant information in terms of just the nature of the threat that we were worried about in terms of the risk for serious violence. So FMM, IRG, the invocation decision, I signed the notes to the prime minister representing the culmination of the advice to the prime minister. That was communicated to him. He responded to me and indicated that he was approving the invocation and the news conference was held. The prime minister made that announcement publicly and, at the same time, kind of behind the scenes, I think it’s fair to say, you would have seen kind of gears shifting. The public service was trying to be ready without getting ahead of the prime minister, the cabinet, or the Governor in Council because if we were going to -- if the Governor in Council was going to choose to invoke the Emergencies Act, there was need to be able to move quickly. So we were moving from -- like, this is a matter of days. The 10th and the 12th, we were still in Track 1/Track 2 option, this option that, “Could we find tow-truck driver in the public service?” to, you know, the evening of the 13th, “We might be invoking the -- the Governor in Council might be invoking the Emergencies Act. Who’s going to do what? What’s it going to mean?” And so we were starting to shift those gears while not, as I said, getting ahead of the Governor in Council, so that if the decision was taken, all of the organizations would understand, okay, what would it mean for them? And I think if you -- as an example, if you look in the notes that we saw from Commission Lucki earlier, you’ll see that she was feeding into, “Okay, if the Emergencies Act is invoked, here are some of the things that could be done as a result of that.” So the public service behind the scenes -- the agencies, the departments -- were trying to be ready in the event that it was invoked because we knew we wanted to be able to move quickly. This was a crisis. This was an urgent situation -- to be able to use whatever powers and authorities were going to be given through the Act and the orders pursuant to the invocation of the Act because we knew were in a -- it was urgent. We had time-limited, targeted powers here; how do you move very quickly? And so that was kind of going on behind the scenes. So as the prime minister then made the public announcement, I would say the public service shifted to, “Okay, so now we’re in the business of invoking the Act and here’s what we have to do to make that happen.” At the same time, we talked about -- a little bit about the FMM. I suspect you may want to come back to that; I don’t know. But officials continued to talk to their provincial and territorial counterparts including the Deputy Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs with his colleagues. Madam Drouin, I think participated in some of those calls. It was happening by what I would describe as “sector deputies” kind of talking to their counterparts, “Here’s what this is going to mean. Here’s what” -- and to maintain that kind of open back-and-forth communication as the invocation was being announced and we were moving into kind of that new phase of -- with the Emergency Act.",26-168-21,168,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And the prime minister -- he will tell you his own story about this -- he was eager to make the decision and to move forward. So we were -- were moving on. We were trying to move quickly. The actual memorandum, which goes to many pages and has tabs associated with it, was being worked on and pieces were being pulled together even as we came out of cabinet the night of the 13th and through the day on the 14th, and pieces being added to it. The -- kind of the conclusions of the FMM, for example, there’s a paragraph in this decision note. This is the kind of decision note we would send to the prime minister -- I would send to the prime minister kind of capturing all that we thought was necessary, pulling it all together in one spot, the culmination, as I would describe it, of the public service advice to the prime minister on the decision as to whether or not to invoke this legislation. And so just around -- some time after three o’clock in the afternoon -- I think there’s a timestamp somewhere about when my office would have sent it to the prime minister.

""All measures taken under the Act must be exercised in accordance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and should be carefully circumscribed…"" Then you go through a little bit of the history of the IRGs. Scrolling down to the next page, this summarizes a bit of what has happened and who attended. Then getting down to a slightly more pertinent part here: ""While the demonstrations started out relatively peaceful, they have grown more complex and expanded into multiple locations in the country. The movement is considered to be highly organized, well financed, and is feeding a general sense of public unrest that could continue to escalate with sever risks to public security, economic stability, and international relations. The economic impact to date is estimated at approximately 0.1 percent of Canada’s GDP per week, however the impact on important trade corridors and the risk to the reputation of Canada as a stable, predictable and reliable location for investment may be jeopardized if this continues.” Just stopping there. So that’s essentially a summary of much of the evidence that we’ve heard coming from the Deputy Ministers this week before the Commission.

26-177-27,"So I will give you my laymen’s interpretation. But Wellington Street is a main thoroughfare. It happens to be right outside my office. Large trucks being parked on Wellington Street over protracted periods of time, I think, you know, Ottawa’s a -- I think it’s been described as a protest city. Protests happen in Ottawa. It is the seat of government. People come to Ottawa if they want to lawfully protest. And so I think there was -- you know, there was - - we don’t manage those kinds of regular protests, lawful protests. Those are local authorities that do that. By the time we had gotten to Sunday night and it was very clear, the RCMP gave us advice at that point in time that the best of her information, at a minimum, the protestors weren’t going anywhere that week, although numbers did go up and down a little bit. Even if you could kind of ignore the fact that there were, from the minute those trucks parked in the middle of Wellington Street, let’s say they were allowed to do that, let’s say that they were sent there, or allowed to park there, there’s a point at which the protracted existence or parking of those trucks and the activities going on in those trucks represented illegal activity. And I think as we got to the end of the first weekend, a reasonable person would say that we had entered -- we had gone beyond a legal protest and we were into an illegal protest, which isn’t to say that everybody involved was involved in an illegal activity. There was illegal activity, including things like by-law violations. There may still well have been people who were there to peacefully protest. But there was a level of illegal activity going on in Ottawa, I would say, laymen’s view, at a minimum, some would say from the get go, but I would say at th end of the first weekend it's reasonable. My assessment would have been it had become an illegal protest, an occupation almost.

And so when we got to this point, it would have been, I think, reasonable to expect that we would have been able to include, as part of the package going to the Prime Minister, here’s a threat and risk assessment that was not able to be -- that was not ready by the time that this memo was being sent.

The Premiers expressed a variety of views - those closest to the situation (e.g., the Premier of Ontario) were completely supportive of invoking the [Emergencies Act] and moving forward with robust measures. A large number of other Premiers expressed concern about the need to act carefully to avoid enflaming the underlying sentiment they considered to lie behind the protest…” Okay.

So this brings us back to something you had raised a little bit earlier, which is that the enforcement action in Coutts had happened early that morning and it was revealed to you then that there was this cache of weapons. And I'm just wondering if you can tell us what effect, if any, that really had on your views that day? And the second part of it is, what you've put in the invocation memo is that indicates there are definitely elements within this movement that have intentions to engage in violence. And I'm wondering if that -- when you say ""this movement"", are you looking at this as a sort of a homogenous movement across the country as in there's a relationship between what's going on in Coutts and what's going on in Ottawa and what's going on everywhere else?",26-187-24,187,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

26-188-14,"So maybe I'll try and take that in pieces, and if I miss any, come back to me. So I think I mentioned earlier that IRG meetings on the -- now I'm getting confused in my dates -- the 10th and the 12th, the RCMP commissioner had mentioned in her situational update when she touched on activities across the country, she mentioned that there was the possibility of there were weapons at Coutts. And she certainly left us with the impression both in the IRGs but as well in the parallel meetings that are going on with deputies that the situation at Coutts was more complex, so why couldn't we solve Coutts, why couldn't we solve Coutts? It looked like it was getting fixed, then it was not getting fixed; looked like it was getting fixed, then it was not getting fixed; looked like it was getting fixed, not. And so earlier in the day, we had seen in the media the RCMP having made these arrests, 11 people, and there being weapons in the protest, I can only speak for myself in terms of what my expectations were. The quantity of weapons and ammunition that was discovered by the RCMP in conducting that law enforcement activity was more than I would have expected. So that, to me, indicated a seriousness and a scale of the illegal activity that was either contemplated at Coutts or people were ready to engage in at Coutts or ready to do at Coutts that was beyond what my prior expectations, based on not a lot of information other than there were weapons. I think the second part of your question, if I remember correctly, is related to the movement, the comment about a movement. I think that what we knew at the time, what we suspected at the time was that there was some degree of organization and coordination going on between what I would describe as kind of cells of protest activity going on across the country, but it did not look like a homogeneous, this was one central plan or anything like that. It did look like there was communication. We could see it happening, even to the extent that we could follow it in the social media and in some of the open source -- open media commentary that was going on. It looked like there were connections between the individuals that were involved, but I wouldn't say that this movement, beyond what's described here in terms of what was happening in Coutts, was one holistic everybody in the country all joined together in one big thing.",26-188-16,188,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

There were some that were coming to protest because they had more -- they had different objectives. There was talk about overthrowing the government and installing a different government with a governor general and that this new government would pass different rules in terms of public health or other rules.

It must be a situation that cannot be effectively dealt with by any other law of Canada."" So that's essentially just language lifted from the Emergencies Act itself. Scrolling down, ""PCO is of the view that the examples of evidence collected to date support a determination that the two criteria required to declare a public order emergency pursuant to the EA have been met."" Scrolling down again. ""Specifically, PCO is of the view that while municipal and provincial authorities have taken decisive action in key affected areas, such as law enforcement at the Ambassador Bridge [...], considerable effort was necessary to restore access to the site and will be required to maintain access. The situation across the country remains concerning, volatile and unpredictable. While there is no current evidence of significant implications by extremist groups or international sponsors, PCO notes that the disturbance and public unrest is being felt across the country and beyond Canadian borders, which may provide further momentum to the movement and lead to irremediable harms -- including to social cohesion, national unity and Canada's international reputation. In PCO's view, this fits within the statutory parameters defining threats to the security of Canada, though this conclusion may be vulnerable to challenge.""

So can you just square that circle for us in the sense of measure of last resort, cannot be dealt with uniquely by provinces or territories, but there are all of these tools available.",26-195-24,195,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

26-196-15,"Right. So we had seen, as you indicated, the Alberta legislation, we had seen the state of emergency locally in Ottawa and Windsor. The province of Ontario had moved forward with emergency legislation of its own. And we had -- if you remember back to the long time ago, the Track 1 work, the Sectoral Deputies were trying to work with their provincial and territorial colleagues to see whether or not if we saw some power that was possible under some provincial legislation, could other provinces or territories pick that up and use that in their jurisdiction. By the time this memo was written on the 14th of February, the view that I came to was that whether there were still authorities that had not been fully used, that the situation overall was a national emergency, it was urgent, it was critical. There was the threat of serious violence that put at risk the lives, the health and safety, the security of Canadians, our economic fortunes. And that taken together, that was beyond the capacity of any individual province or territory to deal with. We were seeing this on a national scale and breakouts or incidents from coast to coast to coast, including, you know, cross-border traffic even between I think it was Alberta and one of the territories. This was a situation which had been escalating. I think we were on day 18 of what was happening in Ottawa. This was a scale, this was an escalation, this was a series of volatility. It didn't seem that there was any province or territory that had the power to deal with this uniquely on their own. That there may have been individual agencies that could have dealt with a piece of it. There were individual sites that could have been dealt with through specific tools. There were -- potentially there were individual threats that could have been dealt with by one agency or actor or another.

26-198-09,"--- and my colleague may have things to add, being more skilled in the dark arts of the law. Section 2 of the CSIS Act is about CSIS being able to exercise its authorities to launch intelligence gathering activities against a person or group because they represent a threat to the security of Canada. The decision maker there is CSIS. They judge the nature of the threat and they recommend the activity be taken. Now let's go over to the Emergency Act. The decision maker in the Emergency Act is not CSIS. There’s nothing in section 16 which says the Governor in Council, who is the decisionmaker who’s being asked to make the decision, has to ask CSIS if it’s okay. The Governor in Council is asked to assess whether, on reasonable grounds, there is a -- I want to make sure I’ve got my words right here. That there are reasonable grounds to think there is an urgent, critical national situation where the health, safety of Canadians, their lives, their livelihoods, the national security of the country is at threat of serious violence. That goes back to the CSIS definition, the threat to the security of Canada. Look under, I think it is -- this is dangerous -- at 2(c) of the CSIS Act we rely on. It is either serious violence or the threat of serious violence. And so the Governor in Council is asked to see if they have reasonable grounds to believe that there is all of the other criteria, urgent, critical, national beyond the scope of an individual province or territory to deal with that is of a nature that would be a threat to national security, which is the threat or existence of serious violence. So the Governor in Council’s asked to make that and, in my view, given the totality of the evidence that we’d seen about the fact that we had protests happening Ottawa, Windsor, Coutts, Emerson, Manitoba. We talked about we had probably a dozen of other ports of entry. We’d had risks of -- and threats of blockades of railways, of slow rolls around airports disturbing that and other critical infrastructure. We had the nature of activity including we had had reported to us that there were IMVE, Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremists, individuals who were seen amongst the protest activities, that there was the risk that they or lone actors inspired by them could -- there was the threat from them that they could move to serious violence. We had evidence through both what was being said and in online of incredibly violent rhetoric, of hate speech, antisemitic, anti-gay, transphobia, misogynistic, death threats. Death threats to elected officials, to senior officials, some of which we didn’t even know at the time. We found out afterwards were even worse than we had known at the time of this note being written. We had the threat of weapons, which we had heard about before the 14th and then we’d seen at Coutts and the size of that cache of weapons and ammunition. We’d heard that there were kids and vulnerable people in the -- in some of the trucks that perhaps were being used to try and keep law enforcement away. All of that and we had a sense that this wasn’t a single headed hydra. This was a -- there was a sense that there was organization, there was coordination, there was a degree of coordination, I think, amongst this set of activities that was very well financed. And so not only did we have what we had, but we had the risk of -- and we’d seen this kind of. It would peter out and then it would escalate and peter out and escalate. But if you look over the trend, since the beginning of the protests arriving on that beautiful day on Ottawa on the 28th of January, we had seen a trend of it getting worse and escalating and escalating. Taking together the culmination of all of that, it was my -- it was my view that we met the test of the definition in the CSIS Act that was -- that was to be put before the Governor in Council to make a decision on reasonable grounds as to whether or not there was a national emergency that met the threat of -- threat to the security of Canada involving the risk -- a threat of serious violence to people’s lives, to their health and safety, to their security.",26-198-11,198,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

26-201-04,"I think the Clerk got it very well, but just to summarize. It’s not because CSIS concludes that within the convoy, however, we know that within the convoy they had individual of interest for them and they have also seen some IMVE that they were following. It’s not because they conclude that not -- no other individuals or groups met the trigger that the convoy as a whole doesn’t represent a serious threat to Canada. So I think we really have to make the difference. They do their assessment to determine under the Act, the purpose of the Act, whether or not some individual or groups represent that. We did an assessment based on what CSIS was telling us in terms of the presence and all the other examples what Finance was telling us, what CBSA -- sorry for all the acronym, but I think you got used to them.

26-201-24,Okay. So I’m going to try and articulate this and correct me if I’m wrong as I’m attempting to wrap my mind around this. But would it be fair to say that we know that there was no specific threat of serious violence identified by CSIS as in there was no bomb plot. There was nothing -- there was no bomb -- plot to bomb Parliament Hill or there was no specific January 6th insurrection planned. But is the position that you’re articulating essentially that there can be a threat of serious violence without a specific identified threat having been identified?,26-201-26,201,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

There was a series of indicators which, in our view, were the threats of serious violence for all the reasons that I think Mme Drouin and I have tried to explain, individual IMVE extremists who were seen in the crowd, targets, subjects of interest to agencies. So it’s the combination of all of these things and the escalation of all these things which, taken together, were enough for me in my advice to the Prime Minister relying, as I do, in everything I do, on the inputs from the community of Deputy Ministers, the product of my interactions with my PCO colleagues and almost 40 years of experience now as a public servant, that, together, represented my list.",26-202-08,202,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So we were in face of a lot of potential criminal offences, but that doesn’t mean that one individual or a group of individuals were giving -- were, you know, meeting the threshold of CSIS.",26-202-25,202,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

26-203-06,Can I try the inverse of that? CSIS does use section 2 of the CSIS Act to trigger the gathering of intelligence about a person or group of people that they think are national security risk. We don’t trigger the Emergency Act every time CSIS triggers section 2 of the CSIS Act. So there’s a definition in the CSIS Act. It isn’t necessarily the fact that -- CSIS is not the decisionmaker in the invocation of the Emergency Act.

26-204-20,"Yeah, no typos. Not picking on typos. What I do want to raise is that a large parge of that section 58 explanation relies on something other than serious violence. It talks about the threat to Canada’s economic security and I think there are at least three or four points and we can bring it up if you’d like to see it in front of you. But they talk about the threat to economic -- Canada’s economic security which has arisen as a result of these various border blockades and everything that we’ve been talking about over the last couple of weeks, everything Mr. Sabia was -- and his colleagues were discussing with us yesterday. So how does that factor in in this sense? Economic security is again not something that is articulated within the section 2 CSIS Act definition that is the trigger of a public order emergency. So how does that work?",26-204-22,204,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
26-205-09,"So in my -- to my way of thinking about this, here was the -- what was necessary to meet the threshold. There were other considerations. The term “national interest” for me takes a step back and says, “Okay, so what is in the national interest of the country?” So safety, security, ability to protect lives. That’s core to national interest. But also what’s core to national interest is economic viability, the ability to maintain an economy, to have jobs, to have businesses operating so that people have a livelihood so they can earn an income to support themselves and their families. So the economic risk, particularly at a time -- and I think I tried to set the seed for this when I was talking about the fact that we were just starting budget deliberations as this was all happening. I think Mr. Sabia spoke of other relevant considerations related to the United States potential legislation that was being deliberated at the time which had big impacts on Canada and our competitiveness, our ability to continue to attract investment. So when I think about national interest, our economic security is actually part of that. And that is about the ability to maintain and operate secure borders to see to the free movement of people, goods, and services, across our borders. We do $2 billion of trade a day between Canada and the United States, the single most integrated, I think, economy in the world. And that was being put at risk. You know, foods, medicines, fuel, supplies, at a time when supply chains were already pretty fragile as a result of two plus years of -- almost two years of COVID. So we were kind of shaky. And this was putting that at risk with big border points. If you look at the Ambassador Bridge, Emerson, and Coutts, just those three, that adds up to about $500 million a day and we do about $2 billion a day in trade between the two countries. So it’s a big number. It’s about a quarter of the trade that was impacted, just those three sites. So economic security in terms of being able to access those things, our ability to be a trusted trading partner. So as I said, we were an export -- we are -- Canada is an export dependent economy and we are in the business of trying to attract investment to be able to open new businesses, expand businesses here. There was lots of conversations going on about trying to attract big company names to locate in Canada. That's about jobs; that’s an important part of our national interest is being able to do that. And investors don’t like uncertainty. They don’t like volatility. They like the rule of law. They like stability. They like predictability and this whole situation was putting that at risk. And I guess finally -- which is a little less on the economic but I think also reflected in this section 58 piece that was put before Parliament, is -- are Canada’s international reputation -- we are a G-7 country. We are committed to the rule of law. And what was being seen in some other parts of the world were protests. I think we saw them at a minimum in France, in the Netherlands, in New Zealand if I remember my media coverage right, with trucks with Canadian flags on them. The Prime Minister was getting questions from international leaders about just what was going on in Canada. So the culmination of all of things are about our national interest. And so in pulling together the section 58, it was about a threshold but it was also about the other factors that went into the deliberations around the invocation of the Act. And if I could, while I’m talking about section 58, just for a minute -- I mean, part of -- because we kind of got out of the invocation memo. Part of what I relied upon in my advice around the -- the advice to invoke the Act, was the nature of the Emergency Act itself, temporarily time limited targeted measures that would supplement provincial and territorial and not displace, that were compliant with the Charter. So it was not just about invoking the Act. It was what Act was allowing governments to authorize to have happen. So it was about the nature of those measures but also the accountability framework that it built into the Emergency Act that had not been used before, including things like tabling before Parliament, a justification on why the Act was invoked, an explanation about the consultation with provinces and territories, a requirement for a vote to be held in the House of Commons to approve -- and the Senate. We know the Senate vote didn’t happen because the Act was revoked. But the House of Commons approved the invocation of the Emergency Act. There was a process to establish a joint House Senate committee. There’s this process, a commission of inquiry around what happened, and transparency around what happened. There’s a very robust accountability framework. So the test was met. Here’s my -- I had a level of comfort in terms of the nature of the measures, as extraordinary as they were, as last resort as they were; and an accountability just to complete the pod.",26-205-11,205,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

I didn’t say that at the beginning about my credentials but my background is really on enforcement and white collar crime enforcement. I can tell you that when people are facing financial issues, this is a lot of stress. And this is violent in terms of stress. So I think our point here was when we were receiving calls from unions, receiving calls from auto plants, receiving calls from trade partners, the impact on the economy was the impact on people.

So we were looking at a range of factors including trust and confidence in our institutions, institutions like law enforcement, institutions like government to actually be able to resolve the situation. And we were seeing a level of public unrest in the country where citizens were thinking about taking matters into their own hands. People were doing counter protests. They were going to the Billings Bridge infamous counter protest to try and show that they were not supportive. This is a pretty risky -- this is a volatile risky situation.

And I know that there was a lengthy memo you prepared; the flip side of the invocation memo is the revocation memo. In the interest of time I don’t think we have time to go through it in any detail.

26-210-09,"So the discussion about when was the to revoke the Emergency Act started relatively quickly after it had been invoked. The threshold was was it necessary to deal with the situation, the totality of the situation facing us? We started to see the impact. We saw Windsor holding, Coutts was holding. Now, we started to see popups in other parts of the country, but one of the biggest situations we were looking at was the situation in Ottawa. We were going into the fourth weekend. There were daily IRGs happening, starting on the 15th, thank you for correcting me about the 14th, starting on the 15th, where there was a daily sense of what's happening, what measures are being used? What else -- it wasn't just like the Emergency Act was invoked and then everything else went out the window. What else can and should we be doing to try to help to address and resolve the situation. And day-by-day ministers and officials were looking at whether or not the situation that -- the sum total of the situation still was of a size and a criticality that we needed to continue. Now, the early days, it's fair to say, we were mostly focussed on implementation of the Act after invocation and who was doing what and how -- what affect it was having. But I would say as we saw the law enforcement activity really starting to take hold in Ottawa on the fourth weekend, the days of the 18th, 19th, more pointy questions were coming back from the Prime Minister and from ministers, ""How much longer do we need the Emergency Act?"" It had been made -- I think the view with the invocation is no longer than necessary, and if we could get -- move out of is as quickly as possible. And so we started to work on, okay, so what were the criteria for invocation, what are the criteria for revocation. I believe you had some discussion with Mr. Hutchinson, in particular, about that earlier in the day, maybe with Ms. Bogden as well, but there started to be deliberate conversations at the Incident Response Group around were we in a position to revoke, were we in a position to revoke, and finally, that culminated in a discussion that took place on the 23rd of February at the Incident Response Group in which the Prime Minister asked everyone in attendance were you ready to revoke the Act. And following that, I -- he had taken his counsel from his ministers and officials. Again, the group production of a note was done. That was provided to the Prime Minister. He chose at that point -- the decision was to proceed to a revocation, and that was advanced on the 23rd.",26-210-11,210,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS.

So there we go: ""Overall the situation has evolved significantly since February 14...and is no longer considered urgent and critical, or a threat to the security of Canada..."" If we just flip down, Mr. Clerk, until page 7. Unsure if that's right. No, I'm sorry, page 6. Okay. So there's a section here starting: ""Since the EA was invoked, the regulations resulted in:...""

They say there's been: ""A significant decrease in the number of minors..."" And it goes on. We don't have time to review them in detail. But essentially, there's a link being drawn here between these indicators that have occurred and the invocation of the Act. So since the Act was invoked, regulations resulted, or in any event, these things have happened. And then if we go on to the next page 7, that describes the operational status. And so as we see: ""All the [Ports of Entry] are currently open...operating normally. Movement of truck convoys continues to be monitored..."" Just scrolling down a little bit there, Mr. Clerk: ""...an operational plan [is in place] has been established to maintain security in Ottawa."" Then it says: ""To date, approximately 30 individuals...attempted to enter Canada for the purpose of participating in illegal protests and blockades."" And I think we know now from, it says there, from Mr. Sofsky (ph), two individuals were turned back using the Emergencies Act authorities, the remainder were turned back because they didn't meet entry requirements one way or the other, vaccination requirements that are under the Quarantine Act.

It's difficult to assess the potential of that group to engage in illegal protests, but then it refers also to: ""Since the end of the occupation...small numbers...""

So there was some lawful protest continuing at least at the War Museum. Going on: ""...freezing of accounts has been assessed as having had a deterrent effect..."" And I'm losing my own place now.

So when you see the population trying to se rendre justice because they are not comfortable that law enforcement or government will do, that is for us like a beginning of a symptom that something worse can happen. We know what's going on in countries when the populations do not have confidence in our public institutions, that's brings some energy and a lot of instabilities, so this is why it was an important element for us, the taking into account the erosion in public institutions and making sure that we can address that as soon as possible to avoid the worse, if I may say.",26-215-11,215,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

It was extra extraordinary powers that came with the Emergency Act were no longer necessary, that we could rely on the existing tools, resources and authorities to be able to deal with to the degree that there was any illegal activity going on. But also, we knew, as the protest was being taken down, the blockade was being taken down, occupation in Ottawa, that some trucks were going to other sites. They were going to Vankleek Hill, amongst other places. And maybe there was other activity going on, but it wasn't of a scale, of an intensity, with the threat of serious violence that we faced at the time of the invocation of the Act. So it's not like everything was ""unicorns and rainbows"" is my expression, but probably not appropriate here. We had not arrived at -- we -- there were still -- there was still a level of activity, including some lawful protest activity, which is reflected in this note, there was still some level of illegality going that we were confident at that point that could be dealt with through -- without the extraordinary measures of the Emergency Act.",26-216-06,216,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

It says this a couple of times in the document. I’ll read hose words at the top. It says: “In addition, PCO is of the view that this is a national emergency situation that is urgent, critical, temporary, and seriously endangers the health and safety of Canadians, and cannot be effectively dealt with uniquely by the provinces or territories.” And I wondered what you meant by the word “uniquely” in that sentence. And I know that you had indicated earlier today that there was some concern that provinces were not fully using the powers and authorities that they had.

I think it was an observation going back earlier in the deliberations around whether or not there was still some scope to work with provinces and territories using their existing authorities to do more to deal with the protest, separate, aside. In terms of the language here, I believe -- again, my layman’s interpretation -- is that the -- what we’re trying to get at in the invocation of the Emergency Act is tht the powers in the Emergency Act are put in place to dela with the situation which is a threat of serious violence, all of those other criteria that you see there, that can’t be dealt with by any province or territory acting individually, uniquely, perhaps properly worded.",26-245-07,245,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

26-245-28,Okay. So I’m still a bit confused about the word “uniquely” and I just want to clarify.

MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
26-246-06,"No. I think -- sorry, Mr. McAdam, I don’t believe that was the intention of this language. It was meant to say that the provinces and territories could not deal with the situation on their own, and that is why the Governor-in-Council would invoke the Emergency Act to deal with the situation which provides extraordinary powers which supplement those powers and authorities of provinces and territories to deal with the situation which we, as you see here, we think, met the test of a national emergency.",26-246-08,246,8,6,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

That was the decision of law enforcement, local law enforcement, as to whether or not they thought they had the resources to do that safely without impairing officer safety. We saw, for example, that they were trying to enforce restrictions on the movement of fuel in and around the convoy in Ottawa, and we saw cases where police officers who were trying to enforce that were being harassed and intimidated and threatened. We saw protesters filling those cans with water as opposed to gas. So there was lots going on. So when it came to the plan, the plan was about how to, as I understand it, the various iterations of the plan were about two parts of this: One was about how do you try and get the numbers down to the core, and then -- so that whatever law enforcement resources were going to have to be used in terms of actual enforcement, you could kind of get the size of the problem down. And the plan, as I believe we had -- had been explained to us was about two phase, but the details of the plan to clear the occupation in Ottawa was not available to us on the 13th of February.",26-274-11,274,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And with regards to determining whether the protest activity involves the threat or use of serious violence, Ms. Thomas stated that: “The only measure can’t be violent of a nature of January 6th.” (As read) And I understood her statement to mean that it’s not only violence that rises to the level of an insurrection.

So I have just a few minutes with you today, so I’d like to ask you just a few short questions and briefly deal about your understanding of what was happening in that weekend leading up to the arrival of the convoy in Ottawa. So if you cast your mind back to that time period -- and we have seen some of the documentation but I’d just like to ask you, did you have any awareness at that point that there were some indications that this convoy of truckers which was going to number potentially in the hundreds in terms of vehicles heading towards Ottawa -- were you aware of that basic fact at that point?",26-286-30,286,30,28,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

I believe the 24th or 25th, we heard for the first time in a team meeting that there were reports that there were -- there was at least a significant number of protesters coming to Ottawa. I can’t remember whether there were other sites at the time that were mentioned or not, but certainly Ottawa sticks in my mind. And the exact details of that, I’ll tell you, I didn’t retain. We -- there were -- those events were being monitored by folks -- other folks in the Privy Council Office. You may recall earlier I said that there was a cabinet retreat underway and I would -- a lot of my attention was focused on supporting the cabinet retreat. But I had others in the organization, in the Privy Council Office, who were monitoring that and conducting daily briefings with minister’s offices and meetings between the PCO and PMO which led into the ministers, and so on and so forth.

And I think the National Security Intelligence Advisor may have talked about some of that.

And sorry for the long introduction, but would you find it helpful in this -- such a situation if it were ever to present again, but to have -- would it be helpful for you to have a more direct line of communication to certain law enforcement leaders, perhaps, with respect to options, tools, status of the police situation generally, to assist you in being as fully informed as possible?",26-290-29,290,29,27,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

Like, it was one of the things, one of the options we were working on, but we were not in a position at that time, because it was not serious enough as an option to start the consultation. I’d like also to add something. I receive a question earlier this afternoon about, you know, another consultation we did on the Emergency Act in relation with COVID. And the situation was quite different. Remember that we also discussed today that the moment we talk about the Emergency Act, that can trigger some reactions, and that was the CSIS assessment on the risk of triggering or invoking the Emergency Act. So we were quite aware that the moment that we talk publicly about the Emergency Act, the timeline to take a decision is very short. It can be a go or no go, but you cannot wait. You cannot put that in the domain without taking a decision. And what we were afraid happened very rapidly. The moment we hang off the call on the FMM, it was already out there that we were thinking about the Emergency Act. So this is why, you know, we were very concerned and -- concerne that talking about the Emergency Act will request a very rapid decision; a no or a yes but a rapid decision.",26-305-26,305,26,24,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

If you engage in a more lengthy process when it comes to protests, that can change how the protest will evolve and how protesters will behave.

But this is why after the FMM we maintained open channels with provinces. We offered a briefing and you know, we were also, if I may say, comfortable with the fact that the Emergency Act was time limited, that we were not displacing any provincial jurisdiction, that any law enforcement was not also displaced.

26-309-08,"Thank you, Mr. Commissioner. I believe I mentioned earlier that there had been a debate in the House of Commons on February the 7th which would have been, I think, in the form of a take note debate, on the situation overall. It wasn’t specifically based on the Emergency Act. I think as with respect to the role of Parliament in -- and consideration of the role of Parliament, in the invocation note I think I indicated to the Prime Minister the broad outlines of the role of Parliament but I haven’t gone into detail. And there was subsequent advice that was provided to him around that. I think it does come back to the point that Mme Drouin was making. The sequence of events from the IRG on the afternoon of the 13th, into Cabinet the night of the 13th, into the FMM the next day, the Prime Minister’s times and space for final deliberations, mine -- to give him my advice sounds like a long time. It wasn’t a lot of time at this point. And it was also -- we were anxious that that news getting out there, that information getting out there would have had an effect, a cause and effect on the nature of what was happening. And it was already a volatile situation. And so there was to be a debate in the House of Commons. There was to be a vote in the House of Commons. And I would say that we thought that that was the Parliamentary process to be followed in this case. I was going to say something else. I believe the Prime Minister had a consultation with the leaders of the Opposition -- in addition, I believe Mr. Thomas, their National Security and Intelligence Advisor referred to this -- on the evening of the 10th, so after the first IRG meeting. I believe the Prime Minister had a conversation with the leaders of the Official Opposition including Ms. May at the time, to talk to them about the situation. So there was a Parliamentary debate on the 7th. There was that telephone call consultation, not on the EA again, sir, to be clear, but on the general situation.

But when we thought about both the nature of the situation we were facing was national in terms of how it was manifesting in different parts of the country. But also, the people who were participating -- let’s say the truckers in Ottawa, for example. They didn’t just come from Ontario. They came from right across the country. And so to be able to use a deterrence measure to try and encourage people to go home, a deterrence measure -- and that was probably what lay behind the use of the emergency economic measures. We were trying to get people to go home. And the freezing of the assets was a pretty important powerful incentive to go home. Those truckers weren’t all from Ontario. They were from across the country so the use of a national tool, national legislation, allowed us to make sure that we were capturing not just, you know, the people who might have been from the particular site that we were dealing with.

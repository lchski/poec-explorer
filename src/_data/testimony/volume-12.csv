So I had designations up to, I don't know if it's the right terminology, but a 500 level, and I had practical experience at every one of those levels in terms of being part of Incident Command. So either being an Incident Commander, what is now known as an Event Commander, Major Event Commander or Major Incident Command through to a District Operations Commander, mostly in my time in the Toronto Police Service and also during my two tours of duty in United Nations Peacekeeping Mission.",12-009-10,9,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-010-10,"I was fortunate enough to have been selected by then Chief Fantino to represent the Toronto Police Service.

I was deployed to Pristina in August of 2001 and completed two tours, coming back home in 2002. I was the Canadian contingent commander. This was a mission where the police of jurisdiction actually had full powers of policing, including use of force detention while building up a local police service.

And to be involved in a unique, challenging, and often tragic set of circumstances, but one that opened my eyes to the conditions globally.

12-012-19,"Well, when I was being recruited for the position, it was very clear to me through the recruiter on behalf of the Board that through their consultative process with service members and community members, that the Ottawa Police Service needed to be significantly changed. Operationally, administratively, from an HR standpoint, the usual sort of change processes that large organizations require on an ordinary basis, and very specifically, culturally. Internally, there was a culture that was less welcoming, less inclusive, less diverse, less equitable, and that had impacts on things like workplace harassment, member moral. Externally, that translated into a real or perceived level of trust in the broader community, but specifically in racialized and marginalized communities, that the service wasn’t, in some cases, appropriate enough and that there was a declining level of trust and confidence. Any one of those things would have been a major change agenda for any external chief coming in. All of those combined required a significant effort of changed management and changed leadership that I was asked, on behalf of the Board, as the incoming chief, to deliver over the course of my five-year contract.",12-012-21,12,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-013-24,"I’m not sure the Commission has all the time in the world for that list. But, I mean, I think the most simple thing to say is any effort of change is going to be difficult, particularly in a large organization. In this case, I believe the Ottawa Police Service is over a century old. And these were long-standing structural deficit issues. Needed investment in recruiting through staff development training. Leadership development in particular was something that repeatedly our membership identified and external auditors identified. And those things just don’t -- that’s not a light switch you can turn on and off. It’s something that you have to build and grow and almost organically move through the organization. Operationally, while they were excellent in some ways -- I just want to be clear, Commissioner, the Ottawa Police Service, and one of the reasons why I came here, had a reputation, deservedly so, of being one of the best operational police services. We’ve heard about their expertise in planning, their ability through missing persons investigations was second to none. They had really advanced -- in some cases, advanced HR systems that were to be seen as a best practice. So this was not a deficit across the board, but there were significant deficits in very specific areas that was contributing to some of the cultural and morale issues. My attempt in the first three months was really to go around on a listening process in small groups, large groups, internally and externally, to identify those areas, bring a command team that was, even in the early days, a struggle, there was significant challenges at the command team level, but people were leaning in and doing their best. I would say, though, that the challenges really came in in March of 2020. Three significant events. The suspension of one of my two Deputy Chiefs, the culmination of a significant internal criminal corruption investigation where three of my officers were arrested after an extensive joint RCMP/Ottawa Police Service investigation, and of course, the declaration of the global pandemic, two months later, the death and murder of George Floyd, the Black Lives movement, and the Defund movement. I think that signalled the start, not just here in Ottawa, but across police services in North America, I suggest around the world, as a significant change in the level of public trust and confidence in policing and the broader justice system. It certainly had material impacts on police services here in Ottawa. The Defund movement put significant pressure on our Board and our Council to adjust the policing budget in regards to size and to change police service delivery in terms of integration. And these were real challenges on top of the significant challenge of change mandate that the Board had explicitly and expressly given to me as the incoming chief.",12-013-26,13,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
12-015-19,"Now, you identified a few challenges that are not unique to the Ottawa Police Service, such as the pandemic, such as the Defund movement, and so on. What about within the organization? You talked about earlier, challenges involving the command team. Tell us more about that?",12-015-21,15,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-015-24,"Well, the command structure, I believe to this day, but I might be wrong, is the Chief of Police, two Deputy Chiefs, and the Chief Administration Officer. Within my first three months in the position, I lost one of those Deputy Chiefs to a suspension. That then required me to accelerate a succession plan that truly wasn’t ready for acceleration, and bring in a series of three-month assignments to the rank of the superintendent. I had two very experienced senior officers at that time. Both superintendents had a lot of experience. And so I rotated them for the first year. But within that year, both of them retired. And after that, the rotation went further into the superintendent ranks. Some were really good fits, some struggled. But it was a very suboptimal situation. In 2021, in the early part of the year, the Board made the decision to end the contract of my Chief Administration Officer. That then required me to look at my command level, and the only person that I could put into that position was Deputy Chief Bell. So essentially, for the full -- almost the full year leading up to the events of the convoy, I had one full-time Deputy Chief who was in a civilian position as a Chief Administration Officer, and I was rotating two -- for the most part, two uniformed Superintendents through the Deputy Chief process. Again, full respect to those individuals. They stepped up, in some cases volunteered. When I asked, they stepped up and they did their very best in very, very difficult circumstances during probably the most difficult time in Ottawa Police history and in policing across Canada. And so I have nothing but praise and thanks for them, but it was a sub-optimal situation that everyone was struggling to make the best of.",12-015-26,15,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-017-02,"Well, the suspension of Deputy Chief Jaswal was in 2020. The subsequent retirements of my two more -- two most senior Superintendents happened over the course of 2021 into 2021. The separation of the Chief Administration Officer was in early 2021. So for the majority of 2021, that circumstance of Deputy Chief Bell being in an administrative function and two Superintendents operating in the uniform function was the situation that I was managing with.",12-017-04,17,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
12-017-11,"So at the most senior executive level, you were having rotating staff, so to speak. What impact did that have on the rest of the organization at that time?",12-017-13,17,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-017-15,"It has a cascading impact on down the way. As you move any officer from one level to the next on a temporary position, not a permanent promotion, you then affect the next level and the next level. I remember once in Toronto someone said every time we promote a new Chief, we have to change out seven positions below. I don’t know if it’s exact calculation, but that’s the ripple effect. So it not only destabilizes the executive level, it destabilizes, to a degree, the other parts. There are always benefits. I mean, people are given stretch opportunities or given leadership opportunities earlier than they maybe normally would have. And again, some rise amazingly to that. Others do an excellent good job, and others struggle. But it does create churn in the organization that was already in churn based on all the changes that were mandated by the Board and the massive external churn by the factors such as the death of George Floyd and the global pandemic. There was another factor that, for me, as a newcomer to the city, as an outsider Chief, I think we can all remember in the early days of the pandemic the lockdown and the requirement not to meet in public was significant. One of the most important ways that any leader can get to know their own members and the community or the clients that they serve is to meet in person. So much is lost on Zoom. Emails and text messages never cover it, as we’ve seen in testimony here. But I lost that opportunity three months into my mandate to actually sit down with my members in the cafeteria and have a cup of coffee with them, to have small group focus group meetings, which I did extensively in my first three months. And even when we could get together, we were masked up so we couldn’t see facial expressions and we were spaced out across a big gymnasium, so we couldn’t really communicate. We had to literally shout at each other. I think all of that, unfortunately, meant that we couldn’t build the level of cohesion internally or externally during a very critical, contentious period of time. A sustained critical and contentious period of time. But we did our best.",12-017-17,17,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
12-018-28,"We’ve heard from other witnesses that notwithstanding the OPS excellent reputation in the past for planning for and responding to large-scale events, the pandemic itself has caused a lot of changeover and depletion of expertise.

12-019-06,"I think it’s actually been well articulated. I will only add, Mark Ford, who -- his father was the former Chief of Police here, an excellent Chief of Police. Mark was an excellent leader. He was one of those first two Superintendents I brought in on rotation along with Joan McKenna. Mark actually was the most experienced Incident Commander and one of the most experienced Critical Incident Commanders. Unfortunately, he retired some six or seven months before the events that we’re going to be substantially focusing on. So that would be one example of many where we had people who had, you know, gone past their pensionable time, had given their life blood, literally, to the organization and to the profession of policing and had made a decision, as many executives in many different parts of civil society, to take their well-earned retirement and go on with their life with their health intact. We celebrated his departure, but he was missing from our team and we really needed our best people to be in the best places possible.",12-019-08,19,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-019-26,"Now, you told us earlier that you came in to the Ottawa Police Service and you were given a change mandate. How was that mandate perceived when you were about two years into your job?",12-019-28,19,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-020-02,"Well, there’s a -- there’s probably a not police saying about police officers. I suspect it applies to everybody. There’s two things that every cop hates, the way things are, and change, so it was going to be difficult no matter what. Nobody wanted things to remain the way they were and everyone was fearful of change to varying degrees across the full human spectrum, of course. And this wasn’t just a tinker around the edge change mandate. It was to go right to the heart of the culture and to the most difficult parts of that culture, the darker part of that culture, things like systemic racism, systemic misogyny. The trust factor between police and the broader community, but very specifically the racialized and marginalized and indigenous communities here in Ottawa. And those were the most contentious topics in policing for my entire career going back to 1988 in Toronto. Any Chief of Police or any command team that took on any one of those issues would be taking on a major, major challenge. Taking them on in the middle of a global pandemic, in the middle of the Black Lives Matter movement and the defund, abolish police movements just made it that much more complicated. But it was still necessary. It still had to get done. Not because it was my mandate. It was just the right thing to do for policing.

Human nature is human nature, so no matter what organization you’re in, you’re going to get some five percent that will adopt everything that’s said without questioning, five percent that will resist mightily anything that is said with all sorts of questioning and then some range in between of people that will move if they’re incentivized or if they feel there’s a sufficient altruistic value around it.

We were still dealing with a multiple-death explosion in our city that killed some five -- four or five people. But I did have a chance to glance through the report. Certainly there was enough information for me to know that this could be a significant event in the near term. My recollection is that I forwarded that email to Deputy Chief Bell and Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson. I understand that there hasn’t been an email to show that, but that was my recollection. But irregardless, somewhere on or around February 13th there was a direction to Deputy Chief Bell to commence an intelligence review of all the circumstances around what was being purported to be a convoy coming to our city and to lead the over -- oversee the work of developing an intelligence threat risk assessment that would then inform Acting Deputy Chief Fergson’s assignment to develop the operational plan for the event informed by the intelligence threat risk assessment.",12-022-04,22,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-023-01,"Thank you very much. Just to take a back -- a little step back, all operations, not just Emergency Preparedness and Incident Command or Critical Incident Command, but all of our Operations, from traffic management order management, crime management that we would should be intelligence-led, information, best practices, evidence-based best practices should inform for the most part our systems, our policies, our procedures, our practices, and the evaluation of the outputs and outcomes that came from that. So that was an overarching theme. How it applied within Incident Command, Incident Command Systems, Emergency Preparedness was again, a weather report that says there is going to be rain tomorrow, well let's try to validate that to a greater degree. Is it going to be raining in a city this large? Is it going to be raining and flooding in one part, or is it across the entire city? Because that will then assess the amount of resources we need and the sequence of events we need to apply. That's an analogy, that's not meant as an actual example. So Intelligence-led as much as possible. Understand the nature -- the context of the situation, the factors involved, the nature of the threat, the risk of the threat, the likelihood of it actually taking place, and the resources necessary to mitigate in the first instance and respond to in -- at the back end. And then to recover from, the recovery period, which I suggest this is still a recovery period Commission, with the City of Ottawa and the Country of Canada.

12-024-04,"Thank you. I believe Interim Chief Bell did reference his own views on the advancements that we had made, particularly in the previous year, and he's absolutely correct. That we had made significant advancements around our Intelligence-led approach to our broader Operations, crime, traffic, order management. Order management is a subset, includes Critical Incident Command and Incident Command System. We had made significant strides in making sure our Information section and our Intelligence section were lined up with our Operational sections, and that we had sufficient crime analysis, administrative analysis to execute and continuously improve on those processes. We did not specifically take on Intelligence-led Threat Risk Assessments as a very specific product. Our priorities at that time were crime, traffic, order management was not at the same level. I think in 2021, we had our -- a very high level of gun and gang related shootings, and so crime, traffic was the number one issue in the community, always is no matter what jurisdiction. So those were really our one and two priorities, and order management was probably at the third level. Because we actually had up until that point a very good record, a very good record of planning and implementing plans and successfully ending a range of demonstrations, but we had made progress. I did make it very explicit, particularly, this one I'm not 100 percent sure on, but particularly around the events in mid-2020, when we started to see large events coming into the city, Wet'suwet'en, Black Lives Matter in June, Justice for Abdi in the fall. These are complex, volatile, political, trust factor events that were contentious and could have gone a thousand different directions. I was very, very strong at that point on the Intelligence Threat Risk Assessment driving the Operational Plan, and in that period I think we did make some significant moves forward around how the intel TRA threat assessment supported, enabled, enlightened the Operational planning.",12-024-06,24,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

The briefings that I was getting was that those two areas were working together. Our Intelligence Group were connected in with all of our policing partners, municipally, provincially, and federally. The Ottawa Police Service Intersect Program had been engaged early around information- sharing, intelligence-gathering, Operational Planning, deconfliction coordination. All of those things were sort of standard for any major event that had occurred under my tenure as the Chief of Police, and had been well-established going back some 15 years under previous chiefs of police. So there was nothing out of the ordinary.

[Second] There is significant popular support for this event on a scale of not seen in recent years. This means the protest groups have access to larger protesters pools than they have ever had access to, which means there will be likely widespread disorganisation and confusion. [Third] Local area bandwidth for cellular/mobile devices will be impacted significantly, causing communications issues for both the police and the event organizers.

12-036-06,"At this point I wouldn’t say unprecedented. I think he’s -- actually, Sgt. Chris Kiez is one of our best Intelligence operators; I had a chance to interact with him quite a bit when I was at the Police Service. I think he actually uses some very important language here that caveats his comments. Talks about “recent” years, “not ever”. And he does that several times in here. The -- what he is describing is very accurate. We’re seeing, generally in protests, I’d suggest over the last 15 years, in the age of social media, a greater level of mobilization. And increasingly last decade, a greater level of -- a variety of funding and logistical support. This email took me back to Idle No More, the -- oh, my gosh, my memory's failing a little bit, Commissioner, sorry, but the Occupy Movement, where these sort of sentiments, crowd size, crowd dynamics, logistics, mobilization, larger disaffected populations, polarized populations that would give direct or indirect support, would directly protest or indirectly protest. I'm slowing myself down a little bit here. These were elements that we had seen. What Sergeant Chris Kiez is saying in here, my interpretation of it, is that the planners need to be aware this is likely going to be bigger than recent events. He didn't give a timeframe. Is that two years? Is that 10 years? And so we need to be cognizant. So it's a good alarm bell, but it's not a five alarm that he's ringing right now.",12-036-08,36,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly

There were efforts made to interdict, to prevent that from coming in or at least mitigate it. And I believe he said that this is not information I had as the time of Chief, so I'm relying on Interim Chief Bell's testimony, that in fact much of that heavy equipment did not make it into the downtown core and he described differently some of the equipment that did make it down there than what has been reported on previously in media.",12-041-28,41,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Secondly, that whether I asked about it or someone offered it, that we would have a constructive discussion around mitigation for those signals. I can tell you, I think it was -- well, I can tell you. I think it was the Wednesday that I received my first formal request through Acting Deputy Ferguson to reach out to fellow Chiefs of Police and request additional resources. If I’m wrong on the date, Commissioner, I’ll stand corrected, but middle of the week, I reached out to London Police Service, York, I believe, Toronto asking for general resource officers, but particularly Public Order officers. It’s my recollection, again, I stand to be corrected, that around this date or on this date, I had another request to reach out for more Public Order. I believe in Commissioner Carrique’s testimony that he was aware of that request. He had two Public Order units that were sent to Ottawa. I don’t believe they were under our ICS control, but they were in the Ottawa area and available. So that is what I would call Inspector Lucas signalling we might be overwhelmed by the numbers, we’ll need to bolster our abilities to not be overwhelmed. Particularly that would be Public order assets, and I had a specific request to get more Public Order assets and I made that request in this case to Commissioner Carrique.

12-045-05,"Thank you. An important question, Commissioner. If I’m going -- deviating too far, please pull me back. But probably one of my top recommendations for you to consider, sir, while we had excellent intelligence and particularly excellent support from the Ontario Provincial Police, this was, from the very onset, a national issue. It was a national event. It started in British Columbia. It was joined on the east coast and it brought convoys from the southernmost point in Windsor. Probably the greatest number of participants and vehicles and vehicles came from our border with Quebec across the five interprovincial bridges. The vast majority of the formal intelligence threat risk assessment reports that we relied on came from the Ontario Provincial Police. To this day, I have a question. Why wasn’t I getting intelligence threat risk assessments on a regular basis of the quality that I got from the OPP from our federal partners? And I want to be clear, they contributed meaningfully and I’m grateful for their contributions. But I’ve said this in the Parliamentary committees and I’ll say it again to the Commissioner. There’s a structural deficit in our national intelligence threat risk assessment process. I’m grateful for the Ontario Provincial Police for filling that gap and doing so to the very best of their ability, but it was not optimal for us or any other jurisdiction that faced any element of these events. And one of my recommendations, sir, with great respect, is that there needs to be an investment in our national intelligence threat risk assessment structure organizationally, institutionally, through integrated organizations and institutions. Some of that will be a financial investment, but it doesn’t all have to be a financial investment. It needs to be an investment to bring this country truly into the 21st century where we are two decades, two and a half decades in.",12-045-07,45,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And I’m sure within that document there will be many, many, many examples of how we could have done better and need to do better going forward.

12-047-07,"Low-hanging fruit, and I believe it’s already been rectified to some degree. A substantive element of our intelligence and information directorates, I would suggest even in other functional units and directorates, the ability for us to conduct open source social media and other online information gathering with the caveats of Charter rights, privacy rights. Absolutely, that would have to be a very transparent process. I stand to be corrected, but when I became Chief of Police, we actually had a unit that would have, by description and definition, fulfilled much of that function. Not all of it. It was either zero percent staffed or staffed by one person because we did not have the financial resources to put human beings into those budgeted positions. We didn’t have the internal skill sets even if we could find a human being to sit in there. I believe that’s been rectified to some significant degree based on testimony from Interim Chief Bell, but that is something it took me almost a full year, two years to convince the Toronto Police Service to do, and this is going back 2010-2011 after the events of the G20 -- actually, before and after when we finally got our first -- it was called a cyber group, but really, it was for pre-intelligence and post- investigative online capabilities. There are very few police services anywhere in Canada, municipal, provincial. OPP is an exception. I don’t know about Sureté du Québec.

The paragraph that starts with “Chief Sloly”: “Chief Sloly was advised that based on the known intelligence reports, OPS did not have the legal authority to deny the Freedom Convoy access to downtown Ottawa simply because some people disagreed with the views of some participants. He understood that OPS did have authority to close roads and restrict traffic if there were public safety concerns, but closures and restrictions had to be commensurate to actual threats or reasonably predictable threats. Highway Traffic Act or bylaw violations alone would not be sufficient to justify restricting access to the city for all protestors.” So that was the view you expressed at the time.

Deputy Chief Bell requested the opinion on the 27th and got it the next day. So this paragraph says: “While the convoy has not yet reached the City of Ottawa, various considerations will need to be assessed, and reassessed, to determine the appropriate response, including: • the balancing of competing Charter rights; • impacts to public enjoyment and the right to mobility; • impacts to health and safety; • impacts on obstructing emergency vehicles; and • impacts to public safety generally.” Do you remember if you had access to this legal opinion at the time?",12-049-27,49,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-051-08,"Well, first of all, just an observation. Deputy Chief Bell made the request on the 27th. Again, if you recall my earlier testimony, this was a four-day event, starting on the 27th, continuing to the 28th, which is the Friday, with the main events on the 29th and 30th, the Saturday and Sunday. This legal opinion, while helpful to a degree, arrived technically in the middle of what we were already dealing with. There were already vehicles in the city, protest vehicles. There were already protesters and demonstrators in the city as we were receiving, reading, and considering this. This did not arrive a week before, or even a day before; this was already in the middle of the events. With that caveat, this is helpful. It certainly articulates to a greater degree what I think most of the police officers, and even my general counsel, Christiane Huneault, would have known and could have articulated differently. It’s not definitive; it’s advice, not direction. I understand that’s counsel’s job, but there isn’t a definitive line that says, “Because there might be any level of any one of these five points you therefore must go to some substantive interdiction, prevention, blocking of the events that are going to happen.” Again, language is important, and I think you and I have talked about this before. The reference of the lawyer who draft this says, “The convoy” I believe. There wasn’t one convoy, ever. There were multiple convoys and there were multiple other individuals and small groups, and I think Supt. Morris used better language than I will but affiliated groups that joined or left on a daily basis.

12-052-25,"--- with your indulgence; Commissioner, with your indulgence? I do want to be clear, though; what was listed in those five points materially happened on Saturday, the 29th. Those -- I think Deputy Bell gave excellent evidence on his own; I won’t repeat his testimony. But what we saw in terms of a violation of our community’s rights, our business community’s rights, the level of unlawfulness, and assaultiveness [sic], in the broadest sense of that terms, including the literal sense of that term, was not what we expected, and was overwhelming, not just for the Ottawa Police Service; most importantly, it was overwhelming for those communities that were most directly impacted by those events that weekend and every other day after that. So this was helpful because it, to some degree, anticipated -- anticipated -- that there would be competing Charter rights; there would be significant mobility challenges; there would be an impact on our emergency services in the ways that they were described theoretically on the page. So there was usefulness in this exercise. It was just a little too little, and already in the middle of the events that were still unfolding around us.",12-052-27,52,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR.

12-053-18,"I guess my next question, after I take you to the passage I want you to have a chance to consider, is, what it would be reasonable to anticipate, in light of this guidance from the lawyer. So this paragraph starting with “Therefore”: “Therefore, while the case law indicates that those who wish to protest have a Charter-protected right in doing so, it is not without limits. These limits, as the courts have recognized, prevent threats of violence, acts of violence, and unlawful conduct. Moreover, these limits also prevent demonstrators from obstructing travel on roadways. It is worth noting, however, that there has been at least one decision where it was found that a blockade for a very brief period only constituted a minor inconvenience and was therefore permissible.” So this paragraph referenced the need to be preserve travel on roadways as a way to limit whatever other competing rights the protesters may have for free assembly and free expression and so on. So having this in mind, can you help me understand why when upward of 3,000 commercial vehicles and trucks are expected to arrive in downtown Ottawa, that this wouldn’t put some limits on where those trucks could access in downtown Ottawa?",12-053-20,53,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-054-20,"Thank you. And as I’m reviewing this document and we’re having this dialogue; all of these things were actually within the operational plan. I believe Insp. Lucas has given evidence to you, sir, that he considered that number; he considered it, that through the combination of the PLT negotiations engaged by OPP and OPS officers, that there were agreements made with as many of the convoys as possible that would significantly reduce the impact of such events by parking trucks and arranging bus or rideshare into the downtown core that would alleviate much of this; that they recognized that emergency lanes need to be kept open; there were significant amounts of planning, detailed out on the traffic plan and other plans. Again, evidence led by many others in that regard. The Ottawa Police Service were neither ignorant of this; and, more importantly, they had taken steps to reasonably mitigate this, based significantly on the intelligence and information available; and ,as we’ve heard by other OPS members, including Insp. Lucas, Deputy Chief Bell, based on the previous experience they had with similar types of events in a reasonable similar timeframe. So I think, again, this was an informative document; it validated much of what we were thinking; it provided a more clearly articulated legal basis for what we were thinking; and we put in place the mitigation pieces that I felt were reasonably presented to me in advance of this, and we had the support of an excellent group from the OPP and their PLT as well. We’ve heard that unfortunately, the majority of those agreements were broken. Let me be careful of my language, and I believe, sir, it was Insp. Lucas that gave an insight that I was only aware of in his testimony. I believe it was the Windsor convoy that arrived first, and largest, into the city and occupied the majority of the red zone area along the Parliamentary district. Once that happened, the convoy’s -- again, relying on Insp. Lucas’s testimony, if I get any of this wrong, I will walk that back. But once that happened, Insp. Lucas described something, I think he called it, like, a chaotic scramble of convoys breaking off and going anywhere. The traffic plan collapsed. The extra resources held in reserve had to be immediately actioned to try to get the agreements that were in place, get the trucks to the designated parking zones. None of that was accomplished in the morning of, and I guess the early afternoon of Saturday the 29th. The Windsor group had claimed, for the most part, Wellington Street and the Parliamentary District, and everybody else wanted to get as close to that as possible. I shouldn’t say everybody else. A lot of other participants for almost the full duration of that event, tried to get to that most prized and prolific public place. And that was another complicating factor on our operations, our traffic plans, our PLT operations, even our POU operations. So I think we had an informative legal opinion sought at a reasonably early opportunity, received literally in the middle of the event, certainly within less than 24 hours. Stop me if I’m going on too much, sir. But my last point in this, and it’s a what-if, and I don’t want to engage in too much conjecture, but other witnesses have provided this what-if. I believe Deputy Chief Bell talked about this. Assuming that even on the 28th, Commissioner, that we decided to lock down the city, close off all the interprovincial bridges and the offramps from the 416 and 417 highways, we would have needed, in Deputy Chief Bell’s estimation, 2,000 officers. I think it would have actually been more. Even if that was our wish, even if that was the clearest conclusion that came from any of the Hendon Reports or any other combination of intelligence or legal opinions, on the 28th of January, we were not going to get 2,000 extra officers into the city and deployed on a plan that could execute and implement anything that relates to this.",12-054-22,54,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-057-12,"Oh, the 29th. But isn’t it fair to ask that by the 27th, when OPS knew that 3,000 vehicles were coming to Ottawa and much of the online messaging suggests that the protests had an intent to stay for as long as the mandates were not lifted, why isn’t it predictable and why shouldn’t the OPS be acting on this advice to take active steps to mitigate access to the downtown core?",12-057-14,57,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-057-19,"Two things. First of all, we did take active steps. Roads were closed. We’ve heard repeated testimony from OPS and OPP senior officers that there were efforts to manage the convoy’s on-route and on the King’s Highways. A new term. I’m so used to the Queen’s Highways. But the King’s Highways. And so there were mitigation efforts. Second thing, and it does relate to the first, the biggest mitigation effort was the work of the excellent PLT teams, from the OPP, which is best in class PLT program in the country. I hope I haven’t disrespected my RCMP colleagues, but that’s a humble opinion. Take it for what it’s worth. They have an excellent PLT program. But our PLT was engaged. I believe from Commissioner Carrique’s evidence, or it might have been Commissioner Abram’s evidence, engaged as the western convoys crossed Manitoba, and they were engaged with all the other convoys. So PLT had negotiated, in good faith, and had received good faith agreements, small A agreements, because I don’t think it's a contract, that the 3,000 trucks would be mitigated substantially by their willingness to move those trucks into pre-designated areas and carpool, for lack of a better term, into the core. They had agreed not to block the emergency lanes. We had no indication, even on this date, that we were going to have the type of public display of unlawfulness, a terrible term, and my English teacher will turn over in grave, assualtiveness [sic] in the broadest sense, sensory, as well as physical.

12-058-26,"In preparing for today, I read through some of my notes and I think I shared with my counsel, I was reading the 9:00 o’clock briefing on the Saturday morning. Whether you find this as validation or not, Commissioner, but the 9:00 o’clock briefing that I received on the Saturday morning, the 29th, was still talking about a weekend event. It described we might have a tent city at the end of this. Tent city in the vernacular, meaning that we would have some five, six, seven, eight, maybe 20 tents somewhere in an NCR park, Confederation Park, and that we would need to remove it, as we had in previous ways. And I’d seen that done during my tenure. There is a bit of a back and forth that I’m quoted in as saying, well, can we make sure that we have our ESU, which is our Emergency Services Unit, down on the ground, and when everybody -- when anybody brings out a tent, can we, in a very smiling and polite way, ask them not to put their tent up so we have less work to do after the weekend? That is literally the substantive assessment. Traffic plan is working, PLT agreements are in place, convoys are arriving, officers are ready to go, INTERSECT is stood up, NCRCC is stood up, and we might have a bit of a tent city to deal with. That is consistent with all of the briefings, intelligence, and operational, on balance, in summary, that I had been receiving up until that point.

12-062-14,"That’s a very important question and I think it was touched on at some point in testimony.

But you could drive south of the 416, is that right, 417, into literally still downtown neighbourhoods, and you would hear honking and you'd see, unfortunately, Canada flags stuck on vehicles and behaviour that was clearly anti-social, but it dropped off significantly once you got south of the 417. Further out into the Kanata's and the other parts, there were probably micro things happening, I'm never really sure of it. So the City would be aware of it, it would be obviously on TV. Social media is exploding at this point and people are dialled in to what's going on, but from a physical standpoint, physical location, you know, 98 percent of it was in a micro concentration, hyper concentration of activity, and trauma, unfolding trauma to our community in the heart of our city, in the heart of the Parliamentary District. And I don't want in any way forget, I know there are federal representatives here, but the trauma impacted on federal employees, elected officials, public officials, the entire infrastructure and ecosystem that represents our Nation's Capital, the Parliamentary District, and the, I believe Mr. Champ quoted, 18 or 15,000 residents in that aera.

So I'm no way challenging wherever that sentiment came from. I can tell you that I met with, spoke with, walked around, and talked with many of the residents, the business owners, I was at a Business Improvement Association meeting that was referenced by one of the witnesses, and I heard a range of sentiments. I saw a range of responses from incredibly resilient and understanding and patient people. An elderly couple, both of them infirm and wheelchairs, travelling through that minus 35 degree temperature, stopped me as I was getting out of my SUV, while doing a live call on a board meeting, on February 1st, I believe, and talked to me. I had -- I think Chair Deans was talking, and I was literally talking to this couple, ""Chief, we know your guys are doing the best you can. Please, it's hard for us to get around the sidewalks. We're trying to do our shopping. We know this is really tough on your team, please do your best for us."" So yes, I heard expressions of hopelessness, I heard accusations of abandonment, but I would say the vast majority that I received directly to me was around resilience and patience. ""Get this thing resolved as quickly as you can, as completely as you can"", but resilience. And a level of understanding as to what the officers on the ground, and I don't say just officers, the members of our organisation. The partners that were deployed already from OPP, RCMP, London, God bless them. I think people understood how difficult it was, but they didn't see the situation resolving in a day, in two days.

None of it. To this day it hasn't. And that is very unfortunate because public trust and confidence in any police service I believe is the number one public safety factor. When any Police Service loses significantly public trust and confidence, that in of itself is a massive public safety threat and risk. It materialises in so many ways. I don't know if the Commissioner wants me to expand on that, but I'm happy to do so.

12-067-15,"So before the break, Chief Sloly, you were telling us about the events of that first weekend and how it hit everyone really hard. I'd like to take you now to January the 31st, which I believe is the Monday after?",12-067-17,67,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au

12-067-20,"We've heard from Deputy Chief Ferguson that that was when the Executive Team realized that a lawful protest has now turned into an illegal occupation.

12-067-24,"My view is it was unlawful the moment a law was broken in or relation to the events. And so for me, that was clearly the Saturday morning. I don't want to in any way interpret Deputy Chief -- Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson's impression. I think I would position the 31st as we now know this is going to be a longer-term occupation. There are fortifications and there are -- there is alarming level of public safety issues at large and we're going to have to pivot our plan to now address the current context and near future context that we're going to be dealing with. So it's in that context that perhaps -- again, I don't want to misinterpret, but perhaps the full Command is fully on the same page and the Incident Command Team is pivoting the plan now into the next phase of this occupying period.",12-067-26,67,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-068-12,"I don't know if there's any significant decision. I mean, we needed a much -- we needed a significant update on the intelligence threat risk. Much of that was in place in the buildup and iterations, but we now need it to escalate to another level. And again, that cycle of intelligence threat risk assessment to then feed the pivoting operational plan to what extent are we going to need different resources, greater levels of resources in one area versus another area, and to what extent do we need to build out sub- plans and other things. For me at the Chief of Police level is what resources are we going to need. What do I now need to do to inform and/or engage other levels including the oversight body of the Ottawa Police Services Board, the City of Ottawa and other factors. And I will be -- I was still trying to understand really what had just arrived in our city, what really was it, and even just level set my own understanding, never mind the work that was being done on behalf of me through Deputies Bell and Acting Deputy Ferguson.",12-068-14,68,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-069-16,"Well, there was no need for a new plan. There was a need for an evolution of the plan that we had, an evolution of the threat risk assessment that was in that plan. Again, I want to make it clear, there was only ever one plan. There were many iterations of it. There was only ever one threat risk assessment. There were many iterations of it.",12-069-18,69,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly

12-070-02,"Again, without the -- with the absence of my notes, but as simple as how many more officers can we redeploy from our overall complement of policing a city of a million people in the nation's largest municipal geography to that micro-ore of the red zones and the immediate neighbourhoods around it. I think, by that point -- again, I stand to be corrected if the records say otherwise, but that point, we had already started to look at changing our shift hours to create a greater volume of officers available, officers and civilian members. I don't know if we had, at that point, reached out to the Association, the Ottawa Police Association to start to negotiate a whole different shift schedule. That might have come later on in the week, but that was the focus, and then external resource requests that went to OPP and other police services to send additional resources atop of what they had provided us already.",12-070-04,70,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
12-070-18,"So around that period, January 31st and the next few days, did the OPS start reaching out to other external agencies for help?",12-070-20,70,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au

12-070-24,"Predominantly, it sort of happens at two levels. You know, the agency-to-agency relationships would already be, you know, phone calls and text messages to people that they knew in other agencies. You know, you'll get something formal from the Chief, but we need X, Y and Z. And then the formal request would come up through Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson and then I would make a reach out to the respective agencies. So probably my approach for the main may have deviated every now and then, would be a text message to the Chief of Police or Commissioner, saying that you'll be getting a formal request, but I'm looking for X or Y or Z. And then my executive assistant would produce the document and I would forward that formally. But once I got a positive response, the positive response I would then forward to our Legal Services Department, and they would go through the process of enabling a memorandum of understanding, an MOU.",12-070-26,70,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
12-071-12,"And now I want to get a better understanding of the options that were open while the OPS were reaching out for external help. So I want to take you to a document, OPS00005631. So just looking at the top, it says ""Public Order Truck Convoy De-escalation Planning Meeting February 1st, 2022."" Do you have -- perhaps we can scroll down a little, so you can familiarize yourself. It says that there's a meeting with the Chief. Can we go down further? There are a number of discussion points. So, for example, the third bullet, there's a notation that, ""Every single option to be explored and is open to discussion. He is happy to come back and further discuss anything that we need him to."" He, I take it, refers to you?",12-071-14,71,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR.

12-072-02,"So if we go down further, ""PLT would like one more attempt to speak with every convoy to get them on the same page."" We scroll down further, ""Every POU we ask for will not be released to come to Ottawa as protests happening now everywhere. We might not get the staffing numbers we ask for."" So there are a couple of things I wanted to ask you to comment on. First of all, there's a reference to things happening elsewhere. What can you tell us about that?",12-072-04,72,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-072-14,"I believe by the 31st, I'm certain there was -- I'm really off base, but Coutts, Alberta was already in play at that point. On the Monday, I don't recall any other Ontario sites.

12-072-22,"But I don't think there was any other active sites in Ontario.

12-072-28,"So by this time, which I believe was February the 2nd or the 1st -- February the 1st, I believe, things are happening elsewhere. And if we go back to the top, one of the discussion points, do you see the third bullet from the bottom, it says, ""POU units across the province needed.""

12-073-09,"So this is the Tuesday. We are into the -- significantly into the pivot at this point. I had received varying levels of input, some of them just random emails, some of them very specific conversations with people with a lot of experience in unprecedented, unusual public safety events. And the validation that I was getting from small i information to large I information based on expertise was this was unprecedented. This was larger than your police service is going to be able to handle. It was national, and in some cases, international in scope. It was fueled by significant funding, significant misinformation, disinformation and polarization, just to name a few. This meeting was my first attempt to sit down with Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson as the Major Incident Commander. I had invited -- I'd asked for Inspector Lucas to be at the meeting. He could not attend, and I respect his reason, although I don't know it specifically. I think Inspector Marin was sent as his designate, I think, but he was a senior officer from the ICS team that was there, Staff Sergeant Mike Stoll, who was the ESU Commander, our POU Commander.

12-074-07,"Essentially, but broader -- I think actually a broader use of trained officers that are actually more effectively deployed, a really good practice here that Ottawa should be recognized for, Ottawa Police Service should be recognized for. And I had brought with me the two PLT supervisors because I had information, feedback internally that our PLT members weren't being optimally used and were feeling out of the loop of substantive discussions like this. And I had requested that the two supervisors be there, and they were there, and you see their contributions later on in the notes. But this is the substantive first time that I'm sitting down with the Incident Command thread, strategic, operational and tactical, asking what are you folks seeing? How are you assessing this? No decision's being made here. I need situational awareness. I need your assessment. We had been blessed with commanders of some expertise and experience from other jurisdictions that were in that room. I think London was there, can't remember if Durham. I believe there was an OPP commander. I can't recall, but there were at least three other agencies in the room. So it wasn't just us talking to us. There was a healthy amount of external expertise. And we went through what I would call -- I won't say it's a whiteboarding session, but a consultation, discussion session that I wanted to get at some point to, okay, well, this is good. Now what's the move forward coming out from this? So that's the context of this meeting.

12-075-12,"So around -- I'd say around the mid point of that meeting, I would have almost turned to Michel Marin and Mike Stoll, who were sitting to my right, and said, ""What's the level of POU that you would think we would need to start to dismantle the red zone and end the occupation?"" And then there was, like, a real-time discussion between my folks and the other POU commanders in the room, but there were others that were chiming in. It was mainly a POU discussion, and I've been in them in many other times before, so I know how this feels. I just sort of sat back and watched this new generation of experts do their thing, and it was kind of cool to watch. And within a really short period of time, it was almost unanimous. This may not be the exact language, but it was close to it, we're going to need everything in Ontario and a bunch more from across Canada. That was one of the moments where I truly understood the scale of what we were facing. Everything in Ontario and a bunch more from across Canada for me was state visits, an Olympic event, G8, G20.

12-079-19,"For all the reasons that we’ve talked about. The size and scale of the events were not going to be able to be handled by any one police of jurisdiction, certainly not mine. That this was a national scope event started from corners of all parts of Canada and arrived in our city. It was already, by the 2nd, in several other locations, Kutz, specifically, I think by the 2nd. There would have been some indication that Queens Park in Toronto would have been a location. This was borne out by a wide variety of polarizing issues, not the least of which was the vaccine mandates, but there were many other anti-government sentiments expressed at all three levels of government. And some of this was just people looking to come into our city and participate in an event, to have an unruly and, in many cases, unlawful party. This was the underpinnings that created this event and brought it substantially into our city. We’re well beyond the Police Services Act mandate of me as a Police Chief and the Ottawa Police Service and the police of jurisdiction, and we were going to have to engage other elements of civil society and likely all three levels of government to make in some way a meaningful contribution to a sustainable solution to the end of it.",12-079-21,79,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-081-09,"That the Ottawa Police Service is doing and will continue to do everything we possibly can do. Just to be clear, that was literally the substantive answer I was giving during that meeting. All options are on the table. We’re doing everything we can. We’re calling all the staffing we can. We are rearranging our plan. We’re calling out to our partners. So before that statement was made -- it wasn’t made in a vacuum. We were hours into a long meeting with multiple questions from multiple stakeholders. I believe my Board were present. I stand to be corrected. City Councillors, the Mayor, “What are you doing? How are you going to end this? When is it going to end?” Please understand, we’re doing everything we can and we’ll continue to do everything we can on a repeat loop, but at some point this isn’t going to end just by the Ottawa Police Service. Even if we could find a way to get all the resources we need, it’s going to come back again next week, the month after, Canada Day. This is a larger movement or series of movements. This is a trend that’s happening across the country and around the world, and so there needs to be more than just a policing solution to it. That’s the context. Now, I did reflect on it and in the days and weeks and now months after that I’ve, in opportunities like this, expanded on that short phrase. I think there’s ample documentation in my notes, note scribes, to talk about me explaining this further to the Chair, at Board meetings, in other conversations and meetings. So I didn’t just leave it till now to provide a more fulsome explanation. Within hours and days of it, I was trying to provide that more fulsome explanation to my Board oversight and to other public bodies and civil actors.",12-081-11,81,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-082-15,"Now, there are those who may say that your statement fostered a perception among the public and the protestors that the OPS was vulnerable and unable to police the convoy. What do you say to that?",12-082-17,82,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-082-20,"Again, like my earlier comment, sir, everyone is entitled to their opinion and is certainly entitled to their feelings. And I can understand that if that was the only thing they heard from me and they were not available to hear all the other efforts I made to clarify that, that that could leave them with a sense that we’d just given up. So I’m not challenging that. But let me clear. I don’t know if that is different from any other statement I’ve made around the role of policing in society. If you recall my earlier comments when I introduced my approach to policing and how I did it, the police are not going to solve guns and gangs and drugs on their own without education, health care, social services, the volunteer sector, communities themselves. The police are not going to be able to solve sexual assaults on their own without advocacy groups and legislative change. So there isn’t any major aspect of policing, crime management, order management, traffic management -- even traffic management, we can’t patrol the amount of highways unless we have bylaw changes, signage changes, engineering changes that are well beyond the remit of the police service to demand and deliver. So for me, this is a consistent them that I have spoken on and acted in accordance throughout my entire policing career. It wasn’t, for me, an unusual statement, but it was heard in unusual and unprecedented circumstances and misinterpreted broadly, badly.",12-082-22,82,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-083-23,"I can’t rule that out, sir, but I think I made enough efforts after that to clarify that and, demonstrably, the Ottawa Police Service kept -- with its partners, kept putting out everything we possibly could for as long as we could, I would very strongly suggest well past where we should have been. Our actions should have spoken louder than words, but unfortunately, by Saturday afternoon, there had been a cemented narrative and I don’t think it ever changed. My statement probably didn’t help it, but I don’t think it was really changeable from that first weekend.",12-083-25,83,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR.

12-084-06,"Now, we’ve also heard from other police leaders who disagreed with the statement from their perspective, in the way that they interpreted the statement, and they felt that there was, in fact, a policing solution. And the way that the occupation was ultimately dismantled proved that there was a policing solution. What do you say to that?",12-084-08,84,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-084-12,"Again, if their comment was based on what was said without the benefit of hearing all the other explanations, I certainly attempted, through the larger calls, to establish the things I just talked about. We are still looking -- we are still doing everything we can. We’re seeking all the help we can. And if we can get 1,800 resources, or whatever number the final amount is to come in, then we could take care of the unlawful aspects of this. But there were broader implications and underpinnings that could bring it back to my city or any other city or jurisdiction. And so sustainably, to resolve the situation, we were still going to need larger civil society, all three levels of government. I don’t know if this is the time to interject around any of the levels of declarations of emergency, municipal, provincial, or federal, but clearly we had indications, and I believe that there were assistances from those various levels, the injunction, the private injunction. And so there are clearly examples where some additional efforts were needed beyond the efforts of the police to resolve it. Local community mobilized themselves in mostly constructive ways. In some ways, less constructive. But there were efforts across the board, from private citizens to public institutions, that contributed ultimately to that success. While I respect the comments of my peers, I want to be careful with my language here, I don’t know any major operation, including that one, that did not benefit material from the supports outside of police organizations themselves.

12-086-17,"I think on that date, I received a briefing on the three options I’d asked for from the meeting on February 1st, the POU options. So that’s a substantive subplan development. By then, we’d had major changes around our internal staffing capabilities, decisions around how to redeploy resources around both the events for the convoy, as well as policing the rest of the City, which still had to happen on a 24-hour basis, obviously. We had made announcements around our efforts to try to address the disorderly, unlawful, and assaultive behaviour, the hate type behaviour that was happening directly in the communities most affected around the red zone, variously described as surge and enforce and contain. So those are some of the examples of overarching -- we were now planning for a week’s cycle, as opposed to a weekend cycle. Requests had gone out to partner agencies not just for police officers, but for planners, people with expertise in PLT, POU, recognizing we didn’t have the expertise or the number of people necessary to do the type of planning and sub-planning that we needed to do. I know I’m going fast, Commissioner, so if you need to me slow down, I will.

12-087-13,"Well that context is helpful as we take a look at this document. Can we scroll down a bit? So in this email, you said you have directed Insp. D’Aoust to convene a full incident command briefing at 8:00 a.m. If we go down further, there’s a recap situational awareness, and then below that, we see some -- two sets of priorities. First of all, the general priorities has a couple of points: “Surge, contain and enforce”. That’s the first point. Second: “Demonstration - fully implement plan - BUT - close everything (roads, bridges highway off ramps, etc.) as early and as long as possible” Third: “Shut down/secure enablers for unlawful and unsafe protest; funds […], fuel […], fun…” I won’t read the contents in brackets. Is there a fourth point? Can we go down? Okay. So that’s it. the first priority -- general priorities.

12-088-11,"So this is the second Saturday. You’ll recall what happened on the first Saturday. Point number two around close everything, at the meeting that was held, that was qualified, I want to be clear about that, clearly access and egress -- access into the city and access into the downtown core was one of the major reasons why that situation on the first Saturday so quickly escalated and metastasized into the events that we’re feeling right now. It was reasonably predictable at this point that we were going to have another large influx of convoys, ones and twos vehicles, and walk across bridges demonstrators that would again likely overwhelm the number of resources, even at that time that we had in the city. And so that was a major public safety risk that, on the second Saturday, was now even more likely to happen. And so that’s the point there. The “Surge, contain and enforce” was announced on the Friday morning at a media conference. And this was specifically to address the level of ongoing disorderly, assaultive, hate related behaviour that our downtown communities and businesses were experiencing, particularly in Councillor Fleury’s ward and Councillor McKenney, although I’m not sure she’s in office now, but former Councillor McKenney, her ward. And the overwhelming amount of community complaints, business complaints were coming from the unlawful, assaultive type behaviour in that area, and we needed to -- that “Surge, contain and enforce” is not for the red zone. That is for the areas outside of the red zone. And the reference around the stacking the day shift and the night shift is to hold back the night shift officers, and then deploy the day shift officers so we have a larger amount, at that time, to be visibly present in the mid- morning to mid-afternoon when the bulk of those arriving demonstrators and activities, unlawful, assaultive type of activities, would be taking place. The third point is around probably less of a public safety piece, but still unlawful, unsafe. Funds that were enabling, to some significant degree, the ongoing activities here, and other locations, but certainly here in Ottawa. Fuel. The trucks needed fuel and we were already trying to deal with the jerry cans and that, the open flames, propane in residential areas that I think has already been spoken about. And the fun. Probably not the best word to use, but these were, I think, significant emotional and psychological impacts on those that felt captured, abandoned, that elements of the demonstration and the convoy events were fun, where they were suffering. And I think there was a reasonable need for us to take whatever lawful and ethical actions we could to stop it or discourage it and negotiate it in some way, and those were largely the actions that PLT, I believe, we’re involved with.",12-088-13,88,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-090-07,"M’hm. Now, let me focus for the moment on the third -- well, the second and third point. The directive to close roads and so on, as well as shutting things down, like fuel seizure and so on. In earlier testimony from Deputy Chief Ferguson, and I believe Deputy Bell as well, they expressed the view that this is an example of a strategic level executive going down, crossing the boundary into the Operational or even possibly technical level of Command, and there was some question about the propriety of a Strategic Level Commander doing that.

We are now reasonably able to predict the cycles of increases on Friday, Saturday, into Sunday, and down. We know what's coming, and we knew what hit us the week before. And this is the Chief of Police calling a special Incident Command meeting to say, ""Are we ready? Do we have the capacity? Are we able to significantly alter what took place last Saturday to what is going to take place this Saturday? And I need to look around the room and eyeball everybody and get a nod or a headshake and then figure out what we need, you need for resources.""

12-092-15,"It's around five or six o'clock. So to give you context, Confederation Park had become a significant site that we were conducting PLT negotiations. The issue of fuel coming into the downtown from Coventry Road was escalating. The level of complaints, legitimate, desperate complaints coming in from businesses and residents are escalating. We had spent most of the Thursday and Friday trying to build towards the announcement on the Friday of the surge and force, contain. The statements ""all options are on the table, we are putting all of our resources on the ground. You will see a visible, different amount -- visible -- a greater visibility of police officers engaged in a wider array of activities, including enforcement, to address the substantive complaints and concerns affecting our community."" And I know I went way too fast there, so I'm going to take a breath and let people catch up. Coming into the Saturday night, I woke up because I wasn't getting a whole lot of sleep those days. I woke up somewhere around three o'clock in the morning, could not get back to sleep. Checked the situation report that came from Duty Inspector Frank D'Aoust, and he laid out information that is contained in this email. The Confederation Park, I'm not reading exactly, but the Confederation Park negotiations ended badly. The Indigenous Elders that had come in were treated badly. There was an attack on one of our sergeants at one of the sites. Other City workers were being attacked. This, for me, was an alarming situational report in the middle of the night that no one else was likely reading, and I wouldn't have been reading until I had woken up with my alarm at five o'clock in the morning. But I read it. So I got in the shower and I got into my car and I got down to the station, and I changed into my gear, and I looked around. We were thinly staffed. I understand why. There was not much to staff with, and we were thinly staffed. And when I went down onto the, we call the Zero Level of our Headquarters, and asked the watch commanders there and the sergeants, ""What's our staffing levels look like for 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock when the bulk of the resource -- when the bulk of convoys are coming in?"" The numbers I got were really concerning. The level of threat from the situational report from Inspector D'Aoust at three o'clock in the morning was alarming. So overnight we had an escalated level of threat at multiple different sites, and in the morning, I wasn't getting a sense that we had the staffing commensurate to what we had announced and what we actually needed. And so I needed to make sure that I could pull together an Incident Command Team and ask these Operational level questions to be assured that we were in a better state of affairs than what I was getting at that point in the morning.

12-095-26,"Yes. I sent a meeting request. I'm concerned about these three areas. We're going to discuss them. We have this meeting, and I'm saying, ""Our Ops Plan is the right plan. What I want us to do is implement the hell out of it."" So surge and force, contain was part of our Ops Plan. Implement the hell out of it. That means you're going to have to have enough resources to do that. To surge into the neighbourhood, you -- I think the number we said was, I might get the numbers wrong, but I think it was 30 per shift over 3 shifts in two neighbourhoods, where you would see 15 extra uniform officers in those neighbourhoods. But if we can't staff to that level, we can't implement the heck of out it, or even implement it. So the staffing request is around make sure that what we've announced as part of our excellent Ops Plan, which is not changing, has the staffing to implement it. That's the reference. The reference around the Traffic Plan, we're supposed to be reducing the amount of convoys coming into the city. Make sure the Traffic Plan is staffed adequately and implemented effectively, so we don't have the same level of surge of trucks and vehicles coming into the downtown, but we're not changing the plan. There was a clarification, and there was a misunderstanding from Inspector Frank D'Aoust and I first contacted him at probably four o'clock in the morning, where he interpreted close everything as literally get the OPP to close every highway off ramp of the King's highways across the entire municipality of Ottawa. He would need probably a thousand police officers to do that, and I would never intend that to happen. I would never need that to happen. I never needed it to happen. That misinterpretation has stayed alive to this day. I clarified in this meeting, down to off ramps that give direct access to the downtown core where our red zones area, that's what I need. I wanted all the interprovincial bridges closed because all of them give direct access to the downtown core, and I wanted to know that we had more roads closed internally than we had the weekend before, but I never publicly in the media, and I never in these meetings said get the OPP to close everything, everywhere, and keep it closed.",12-095-28,95,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-098-08,"No, no, no, that -- I agree with you on that, but that's the announcement, but I'm asking you about the purpose of the meeting on the 5th, the morning meeting. So if we go to this paragraph that says, ""Chief Sloly saw the situation report early on the morning of February 5[th]. In response, he held several early morning meetings to ensure that OPS's surge and enforcement strategy and efforts to harden the downtown core were proceeding properly. He wanted to ensure that OPS had the staffing to implement what it had announced on February 4[th]. Specifically, he spent Inspector D'Aoust an email with a list of meeting topics and asked him to organize a meeting with the members of the IC..."" I believe that's Incident Command?

12-099-04,"Yes, but the plan was already to have those staff in place. I wanted to make sure they were actually available. A lot can happen in 24 hours. Potentially, without me knowing, the Incident Commander could have developed a plan that was going to take resources away from those commitments. If they had said we can't staff your surge and enforcement because we've got all those neighbourhood officers doing something else, or we had a shooting in the west end last night and it's an extensive scene and we can't redeploy our traffic to that, then I would have understood. We couldn't staff what we planned. But we weren't trying to figure out just then if we had the staffing for what we had announced.

12-099-22,"All right.

I want to ask you now about the location priorities, which is further down. There we go.

Those were established, I believe, through the Incident Commander up through Trish Ferguson. She was the first that I recall hearing about the red zone and the footprints were described to me in subsequent meetings from probably the Sunday through until now. Confederation Park, as I had advised, I think that started up somewhere around the Thursday. I might be mistaken, but Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, but certainly had escalated to a significant event for us to be managing on the Thursday night, Friday into the weekend.

Diesel and propane and wood had already been established through briefing cycles coming up to me as priorities that the Incident Commander and the team were working on, and there's lots of communication around that, and questions and public forums, so that was already well established.

I counselled both that such major changes in the leadership of the [Incident Command] was to come to me for final approval outside of Operational exigencies.

We're in the middle of what is now I consider a national security crisis, my opinion, it doesn't have to be held by others; certainly a local public safety crisis; and one, if not the most important functions is the Incident Commander. The Major Incident Commander, Event Commander, Incident Commander, that is my entire understanding of leadership capability and capacity to orchestrate all of what needs to be done across the Incident Command System just so that we can continue to provide adequate effective policing. That is a major level change, and one that was made without any consultation, any communication to me, and one that appeared to have been kept secret from me until literally it came up in the briefing meeting that I had called. I don't even know if to this day that I didn't call that briefing meeting that I wouldn't have known about it until the Sunday, the Monday or the Tuesday. What's also materially important here... If you scroll back up, please. Right there. ""I asked why I was not advised"" -- sorry: ""...he was the new Incident Commander installed this week and was leading the implementation..."" This is Dunlop: ""...was leading the implementation of the preferred POU [plan]."" Superintendent Dunlop was not at the February 1st meeting in Kanata, that two hour plus meeting, where we had that discussion around ""where are we now, and how can we get out of this?"" He was not a part of the discussion of the Public Order Unit Commanders who were expert in that area. How could he have been replaced to lead this if he wasn't part of that essential meeting? I left explicit instructions, and it was in the notes that you showed earlier, ""If you need anything more from me, if you need to clarify, I'm available to you."" This is clearly one of the most important things that I've asked Trish Ferguson and her Incident Command Team, who were there represented as fully as they could be, Lucas couldn't attend, you recall, for whatever reason, ""This is critical. I need a set of options in three days before the weekend events come."" And somehow in that timeframe, without me understanding or even knowing, a switch of that magnitude was made and then put in charge of the planning for that that I was expecting a briefing on. I finally got a briefing later in the afternoon on the 5th of those three options. Could it have meant I could've had a briefing on the Wednesday or the Thursday, possibly, and could that have meant that we could have started two days, three days, four days earlier to actualise that scale of Operations, including making the request for the Public Order Commanders on scale that I was told on the February 1st meeting? We lost time, and clearly there was a lot of confusion. Even this note demonstrates I'm still not quite sure who's running what. And for Chief of Police, with the citizens and trauma and victimisation that they were under, our own members as struggling as they were, at best I can call this a significant lack of judgement on behalf of my two Operational deputies.

12-120-23,"--- disagree with it. From my earliest days as a -- in training as a Public Order Unit Commander and in all of my times as a Public Order Incident Commander, Incident Commander, Major Incident Commander, Duty Operations Commander, the use of engagement -- community engagement pre, during, all the way through, even in the restoration phase has been something I was trained to and did in both police services that I had the honour to be part of, Toronto Police Service and the Ottawa Police Service. While the PLT program expanded from an RCMP-OPP kind of technique to broader -- to other police services, I -- for that most part, I was out of policing at that time. I had left the Toronto Police Service and was a partner at Deloitte. I came back into the Ottawa Police Service and the term Police Liaison Team was a new term to me, but their function was not new at all to me. I had deployed such tactics, seen them work effectively and less effectively, and fail, but always had that approach. Come back out of Incident Command -- and I know I’m going too fast. Come back out of Incident Command, the concept of community engagement is something that I had been championing for and had done at multiple levels for multiple decades. There isn’t anyone on God’s green earth that would have to convince me of the necessity and the value of community engagement, trust building, negotiation, mediation, de-escalation in any aspect of policing, not the least of which in Incident Command, Critical Incident Command. I have never in my entire life as a police officer, certainly as I became a senior officer and an executive and Chief of Police, have advocated for more enforcement over anything else. My record in the public is exhaustive on that. The operational plans I led in the Toronto Police Service when I had 4,000 officers under my control, responsible for anti-gang activities, always had a significant element of mediation, negotiation and engagement. I built the Toronto Police neighbourhood policing strategy, and brought that here to Ottawa. So this concept of Peter Sloly as being some sort of ultra-enforcement-driven focused leader is a narrative that someone has constructed to attack my character, but bears no resemblance whatsoever to my actual record in policing, including my time as Chief of Police here in Ottawa, including the three weeks that I was in charge at the Ottawa Police Service during these events.",12-120-25,120,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

At that time, PLT had been at Coventry Road for at least two hours, engaging with protesters. Staff Sergeant Ferguson informed Superintendent Patterson that PLT was negotiating with the protesters and that they were compliant, but Superintendent Patterson indicated that he intended to proceed with the public order operation. Staff Sergeant Ferguson attempted unsuccessfully to convince others in OPS not to proceed with the public order operation at Coventry Road. At 5:00 p.m., Inspector Marin reiterated Superintendent Patterson's direction to Staff Sergeant Ferguson that they did not want the fuel from Coventry Road to be displaced and that they were proceeding without warrant. At 5:10 p.m., Staff Sergeant Ferguson contacted Deputy Chief Bell and advised him that the enforcement operation would undermine PLT's negotiations, which had been proceeding for at least two hours. Staff Sergeant Ferguson informed Deputy Chief Bell that protestors were compliant. Shortly after the call ended, at 5:18 p.m., Deputy Chief Bell contacted Staff Sergeant Ferguson and informed him that he agreed with Superintendent Patterson's decision. Later that evening, Staff Sergeant Ferguson learned that Deputy Chief Bell supported Superintendent Patter's decision because three convoy vehicles had left [the] Coventry Road site and were transporting fuel to supply protestors downtown.""

If Staff Sergeant Ferguson, who probably at that point was a couple of days into his assignment, he's not trained on PLT, and has not, up until that point, been materially involved in the intelligence threat risk assessment, all of the various iterations of the operational plans, and the subplans is all of a sudden in the middle of PLT world, he's likely not aware of the larger intelligence and the larger frame of operations that Superintendent Patterson is. Even Superintendent Patterson is probably 24 hours into his job. So there's a lot of people who've been all of a sudden moved into different positions, after a period of Rheaume, Dunlop, Patterson. There's a lot of confusion happening at this point. This is clearly an evidence of a suboptimal system trying to right itself. People trying to do the right things, but not really coordinating and in some places conflicting. And people trying to get help, but going up the wrong chains of command and the wrong chains of command getting involved in areas that they shouldn't be getting involved in. If this is accurate, Deputy Bell should have contacted Deputy Ferguson. There's a concern from PLT. I'm making you aware of it. Can you manage that back down? That would have been more appropriate. So there's a lot of things happening here. It's on the basis of one individual's concept, and that's an individual who's probably relatively new into their position and has never been trained on PLT.

We're still in COVID. I don't know how many times they've been able to utilise that training in any substantive way before the arrival of this massive unprecedented event. And then they're literally asked to do the impossible from the beginning to the end, and do the best job they possibly. But no, there isn't a optimal optimisation within this incredible unprecedented even between that Command frame, there isn't. And even with the extra help that we got from the OPP and the arrival of experts, like Inspector Beaudin, we weren't going to be able to flick a switch and all of sudden go from OPS immaturity, to OPP excellence within the dynamics of what's taking place in real-time in the City of Ottawa.",12-134-27,134,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-135-19,"Thank you. Well, first of all, again, Commissioner, with your -- the Incident Command System, I had the honour and pleasure in I think 2008, 2009, along with Mike McDonell, then of the RCMP, and Sue Sullivan, who was then a Deputy Chief in the Ottawa Police Service. All of us had been trained up on the Incident Command System. We believed that that was the appropriate Incident Command System for the types of demonstrations we were seeing in the new century. I hate to make myself old, but that's what we were back then. And we had made presentations to the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police that to avoid integration challenges we should have a standard Incident Command approach across the province. We were able to get the OACP Executive to adopt that, and that became, through that process, I don't want to say the standard because I can't say for sure, it's written into the current Police Service Act standards, but that became the default standard for Incident Command across the province. We attempted to that at the CACP level. I got promoted, and I don't know where that ended up. I now know there's a national framework. Long way of saying we are going to increasingly have to bring large organisations together across potentially multiple sites. We need to be working off the same understanding, nomenclature process, we need to narrow that gap of a grey zone between Strategic, Operational, and Tactical. I would suggest we also need to narrow the grey zone around a working Incident Command structure as it sits into the regular business of policing in any jurisdiction or multiple jurisdictions. Training needs to be standardised, nomenclature needs to be standardised, equipment needs to be standardised, joint training needs to happen, and all of that has to happen a long time before a major unprecedented paradigm-shifting event, like what we just saw arise, in any jurisdiction. This is one of those structural deficits, sir, that have existed for decades in policing. It doesn't all require money, but it's going to require a little bit of investment on that end. But it requires an investment of time and resources and focus. And what this event did to Ottawa, to Ontario, and Canada was exposed that type of structural deficit. It's the same concept of structural deficit around intelligence gathering. We can't afford to duct tape our way through these incidents anymore. Unfortunately, this reads like a duct tape effort to get through a really complicated dynamic situation. I need to be clear, every name here did their best in the circumstances they found themselves in. I don't read into anything here a deliberate attempt to undermine or frustrate or cause risk to the public.

12-139-03,"Now, Chief Sloly, just before the lunch break, we spoke about a number of issues that I also wanted to clarify so that there's no misunderstanding. First of all, I asked you about the date when you found out that Superintendent Rheaume was replaced by Superintendent Dunlop, and I believe you said that was on the 5th of February. Now if I could take you to a document, I want to see if that would refresh your memory. OPS00014484. So if we go to page 2. So it appears that on the 3rd of February, these are, again, notes to yourself. On the 3rd of February at around -- well, in the morning, you attended a meeting with both deputies on Teams with Superintendent Dunlop. What was your understanding as of the 3rd about Superintendent Dunlop's role if he was not the event commander?",12-139-05,139,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-139-18,"Thank you. On the whole, sir, I wasn't sure what his role was. I had understood that Staff Sergeant Mike Stoll would be the primary presenter of the analysis that came out of that meeting on the 1st; a range of three options, I have described them, but not necessarily accurately as to what they would come back with; and a preferred option, including the implications of resources, et cetera, et cetera. On the 3rd, if that's the Thursday, that would be the Thursday, there were two, yes, there were two meetings, one at 10:30, and then another one I think maybe around 12 o'clock, where I was waiting for Mike Stoll to give that presentation. I think the notes indicate that he wasn't available, the presentation wasn't on what I had asked for, and I was saying, ""Look, I just want that presentation that I had asked for."" So there were two I would call aborted attempts to provide that on the Thursday morning, the first one around 10:30, the next one around 12 o'clock or so if my mind is accurate. Finally, the third attempt, which occurs I think on the afternoon I think of the 5th, the Saturday, I get the three options, I get their preferred option at that point. So I'm still not sure even at this time why Dunlop is, Jamie Dunlop, sorry, Superintendent Dunlop is involved in the presentation and what his role in it is. My recollection, I stand to be corrected, is he wasn't introduced as the Interim Event Commander or the Event Commander, that's my recollection, and my confusion is based on that point.",12-139-20,139,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
12-140-17,"Okay. The other thing that we spoke about was with respect to the Coventry incident, and we were attempting to draw some lessons from that event. One of the issues you identified was the fact that Staff Sergeant John Ferguson went outside the Incident Command System when he sought guidance from Deputy Chief Bell. Now, if Staff Sergeant Ferguson were -- if he had concerns about the direction that he was getting from Event Commander Mark Patterson, Superintendent Patterson at that time, who should he have gone to?",12-140-19,140,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-140-27,"So while it was confusing, again, I don't want to characterise it as he did the wrong thing, I just want to be clear about that, John Ferguson, there would have been options. John could have gone to the Incident Commander, which at this time should've been Russ Lucas. He could've gone to the Event Commander and explained -- attempted to further explain, and if that wasn't happening, he could've gone to the Major Event Commander, in that case -- Major Incident Commander, in that case it would have been Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson. So there were options for him to engage. I understand it seems to have been he was doing his best to get people engaged around something he thought was important.",12-140-29,140,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
12-141-11,"But just so we understand, Superintendent Patterson was Inspector Lucas's superior.

FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-141-16,"Challenging, but still appropriate. There is an Incident Command chain of command and then there's an organisational chain of command. So at any point when there is a disagreement in the chain of command, if done professionally, if done timely, and if done seeking a constructive outcome, not for rumourmongering, not for undermining, not for any other personal agenda, you can engage that chain of command in trying to reach some sort of a better outcome.

12-141-25,"Now, I understand from Inspector Lucas's interview summary that he thought by that time, around 5th or 6th of February, he had -- his role had diminished to more akin to an Operations Chief at the tactical level. So if Staff Sergeant John Ferguson had issues about the Operations, is it not arguable that he shouldn't have gone to Inspector Lucas?",12-141-27,141,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-142-04,"And I -- again, I want to be careful. I received that through information that's been presented at the testimony. Myself, I wasn't aware of that, so it's new information for me. That Inspector Lucas's perspective on his changed role is new information for me. If that was materially the case, if that was known to everybody, and if it was known to John Ferguson, yes, he would then have another challenge of who could he turn to, I would accept that, but this is all new information to me too. So it's just conjecture, sorry, conjecture at this point to try to answer your question, sir.",12-142-06,142,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
12-142-15,And I appreciate that you are doing the best you can. We're also trying to understand what lessons to draw from it. We just don't want to draw the wrong lessons. So the other option that you identified was for Staff Sergeant John Ferguson to perhaps approach Deputy Chief Ferguson because she was by then the Major Incident Commander. But wasn't that also problematic because they are married?,12-142-17,142,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-142-24,"At some risk to go into the realm of conflict of interest in relationships and organisation, I mean, that's -- there is that challenge, but in the frame of the Ottawa Police Service at that time, there wasn't any breach of policy. And so it would've been appropriate if he felt it had, again, you know, constructive, objective, not unprofessional, not undermining, not self-seeking, to have sought the intervention of or at least to have provided his information to the Major Incident Commander. I do also recognise, if I understand the context as to what happened, this is sort of a real-time unfolding event. It seems to me, again, I may be wrong, it seems to me that there wasn't an opportunity for Staff Sergeant Ferguson to wait for a briefing cycle to raise the concern when all the people would've been around the table, and then that would've allowed Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson, or even Superintendent Patterson, to reconsider. It seemed like he was trying to get a real-time decision in the midst of an operation. So the third option would've been to wait for a briefing cycle, raise it as part of the briefing cycle to try to deconflict it and make it better going forward. I don't think it was appropriate in that circumstance.",12-142-26,142,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly

12-143-21,"I certainly can't be quick to judge or to in any way attribute blame.

They were not under our incident command system control but they were available in an emergency and they had, certainly, a range of important duties to manage. I believe, at that point, we still had OPP Public Order Units, again not -- if I understand correctly, not under our incident command, supporting Parliamentary Protective Services but, again, in the theatre -- general area of the theatre. Within -- what I would say within the incident command system deployment, there were general duty officers from the OPP somewhere in the range of 30, 40, 50 -- and I stand to be corrected on numbers -- as well as a range of other municipal police services agencies’ contributions, London Police, Durham Regional Police.

I asked each of the functional commanders -- so that would again include Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson in her functional role, Deputy Chief Bell in his functional role, and Chief Administration Officer Dunker in her functional role to identify supports. The reason for the two, sort of, coordinated requests, we needed a certain level of capability, resource capability, and predictability within the incident command structure to work under that structure to achieve the goals of ending the events in Canada, but we were still struggling with staffing for our policing jurisdiction responsibilities. And I don’t know if at this time we’d finished the negotiation with the Ottawa Police Association for the shift schedule change, but we were struggling on both ends, staffing to a level beyond just maintaining the red zone through the incident command piece, and staffing to maintain our contractual obligations and member health and wellness requirements in the general police services to the rest of the million residents in the city. The sum total of those 1,790 odd resources reflects all of the different aspects that we were looking for and they were broken down short-term, mid-term, longer-term. The bulk of the resources, I would suggest, were more short term, A significant amount was mid-term, and then another amount would have been long-term. That would have been assisting in prosecutions after the fact, the case management, crime analyst, all that together.

12-159-04,"Just for clarity, sir, just while the document is being searched, my understanding, and I stand to be corrected, I had a meeting with my command team on the afternoon of the 5th, after the board meeting was over, where I was interrupted for part of the meeting, had to leave to go out for a phone call and come back, and it was in that meeting I said, “Look, we’ve just gotten direction from the Chair. We need to produce this over the next day. Start thinking about what you need. This is a big lift that we’re going to have to do.” Then on the 6th, after my team had worked through the night, through the day, the number of 1,790 odd was broken out into various functions.

12-159-19,"I could be off on the dates. I -- but the date of the email is not in question. The date of the email is the 7th, as you can see on the screen. And it was on the 7th that Supt. Abrams wrote to his superiors, including Deputy Commissioner Harkins, and this is what he wrote: “Deputy, I did not want to mention this on the call with the group but [I] feel it important for you to have this information. On my call with OPS Command last night Chief Sloly asked his people to send him their resource needs. They told him that they need 250 members a day to run things. Chief Sloly told them that if they need 100 he will ask for 200, if they need 200 he will ask for 400. He seemed very comfortable asking for twice what he really needed. He looks at it that it [sic] the other partner police agencies can’t meet the ask number then Ottawa may still get more than they really need.. Was a very strange call to be a part of. Hearing the Commissioner say that he may ask for a thousand members I felt you should be aware of the above.” So that’s what he wrote about his observation the night before when he attended the meeting with the OPS command. What do you have to say to this?",12-159-21,159,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-160-19,"It’s a very strange interpretation by Supt. Abrams. What I can tell you was that at one of the meetings that I recall on the 5th, maybe it was the 6th, but what I recall on the 5th, I said to my folks, “Up until now, I’ve been getting requests that I would call incremental. What we need to get through this day or this weekend. What we need to do, and what the Board Chair has asked us to do, is what do we need to get to a safe, complete, successful, sustainable end to the events happening here in Ottawa? This could take weeks, so I need you not to think incremental. I don’t want you just to think in a short-term cycle of planning. I need you to think exponential, short, medium, and long-term.” It’s in that context, I don’t know if I gave the exact if they say 100, 200, but “Don’t let your thinking be incremental. You have to be able to consider the full range of resources. We’re not going to get to be able to make this request again, so think about everything you might need. A special constable, crime analyst, computer dispatcher, someone who can do open-source social media. Whatever you don’t have right now to meaningfully contribute to the end of this -- these set of events, or to not be able to continue delivering our basic police services, this is the time to put that resource request into this.” So I was not, in any way, trying to put any other police service in a situation where they would need to give us tings that we did not need. If it was interpreted that way by Supt. Abrams as a guest on that meeting, that’s unfortunate. If it was reported that way to the Commissioner, that’s very unfortunate.",12-160-21,160,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly

12-161-25,"You’ll very rarely hear me agree to an or. I’m always an and person. So it isn’t one or the other. Particularly in fluid events that literally up until the day of the 29th, no one really knew what was coming, the plan will always need to make adjustments, in real time, sometimes. But at any point, where you have to make a commitment to some portion of the plan, you need to have some relative insurance of the predictability of the resources available. So these are not consecutive exercises. They are almost inevitably concurrent exercises. A lot of my concern about how this whole issue has been portrayed is it’s been portrayed as one or the other, and the preferred one seems to be planned before resources, consecutive. In this instance in real time events, whether they be natural disasters, or unplanned protests, or protests that are so fluid in the making that you don’t have the benefit of months or even weeks of advanced planning, you’re literally making resource requests in real time as the threat assessment or the context of the circumstances change. We saw that play out in the pre-arrival plan. You asked the question earlier on. As the warnings increased, did your resource requests increase? Yes, they did. Not because we stopped everything and wrote a perfect plan for the next resource request. We continued with the planning process, while we continued with the intelligence process, while we continued with the recourse request process. And quite frankly, that has been the way that I have seen Toronto Police Service work in all my time there, that has been the way that the Toronto Police Service supported many other jurisdictions, that is the way that my experience with the Ottawa Police Service was during my time as Chief. I had never, never once before in my entire career been asked to provide a fully detailed plan with subplans laid out, timing, and exact details and logistics as to where people were going to sleep, what uniforms they should bring, before we sent out a request in good faith to good police partners and said, “We’ve got something big.

12-166-02,Yes. So it definitely was not the normal process. There were a series of communications from the end of the Board meeting on the 5th through the 6th into the 7th as to what role the Board and the City could play in supporting the Police Service to get the needed resources. The substantive outflow of all of that was a desire by the Chair and the Mayor - - they arrived at that through some level of discourse to have a joint letter to the other two levels of government to seek their direct support in securing those resources.,12-166-04,166,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-166-19,"These were extraordinary circumstances, and so -- and there was an increasing and significant desire, would be the -- I think not quite the right word -- for the Board to be seen as actively supporting the service in one of its few ways that they can, which is securing resources for adequate and effective policing. Again for context, the start of the February 5th Board meeting, the Chief -- sorry, the Chair in her opening comments talked extensively about whether or not circumstances in Ottawa would allow the Ottawa Police Service to be able to provide adequate and effective policing. The transition from her opening statements to me was a question directly to me, “Chief” -- I’m not quoting exactly, but as close as I can -- “Chief, do you have the resources necessary, the ability to provide adequate and effective policing in the city?”. And then there was a substantive period of that Board meeting spent on that topic. The sum total of that was the request, the direct request from the Chair, for the list of resources that we would need. This is not ordinary, but I do believe it falls somewhere within the realm of the Police Services Act for the Board to make sure that we had the resources necessary to provide adequate and effective policing. And I believe this is one of the ways in which, again, Chair Deans may -- former Chair Deans may choose to frame it differently, but I interpret it as a genuine effort to exercise some level of their mandate to support getting those resources. There was then the additional layer of whether the Chair would sign this alone or the Mayor would join in signing.

12-169-09,"Again, I can appreciate concerns raised certainly throughout this process and in discourses well beyond these walls. This is -- this, again, is not an -- not a practice that I’ve experienced in my policing career where there would be a requirement for detailed completed plans submitted and then analyzed prior to any substantive release of resources. It wasn’t -- it wasn’t in my experience around planned events like the G8-G20, and it certainly wasn’t my experience in unplanned or highly fluid and contentious events like the one that we experienced here. If this had become a new standard and a new expectation in policing, I was not aware of it, and I had, at that point, been a Chief of Police for over two years. Secondly, we did have a plan. It was an ongoing, evolving plan. I would by no stretch of imagination suggest to anyone, the Commissioner or anyone else, that it was an excellent plan. It was a robust plan, given that we were still pivoting from what we'd experienced just a week before. Canada was still trying to figure out what was going on across the country, just as we were trying to figure out exactly what was going on in the city. And we had been literally using every resource possible, just to get through hour by hour, day-by-day operations and the planning for those operations. There was no additional capacity to be able to produce such a level of standard plan while we so desperately needed those resources. I think, unfortunately, it became a misinformed issue around an unrealistic expectation, and, unfortunately, that caused a lot of concern across the board, inside our organization, and clearly outside of our organization.",12-169-11,169,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

What tends to happen is the Incident Commander almost exclusively will be from the police of jurisdiction, who will utilize the resources that they know best and use the most frequently, and then go and tap into the other resources. Inevitably, that means that the external resources will be underutilized. It is in no way surprising for me to have heard that at points during the entire three weeks that I was involved in this, that there might have been officers from some police department that didn't get their briefing at the right time and may have even spent the better part of the day not doing the things that they thought they were going to be doing.

The concept of a measured approach I think that's been talked about usually in terms of PLT and secondarily in terms of use of force, a measured approach is we need more resources. Let's ask for it. We need help with the planning for those resources. Let's get that. We might need to integrate our operations to a greater degree than we have every considered before. Let's work on that. Okay. So we've got -- we're getting more resources. We are stepping up integration. Our planning now is getting to a much greater level of efficacy. Now we're going to consider a unified command. That is a measured approach of stepping up. I think it would be irresponsible, as I said before, and I'm sticking to that, I think it would be unprofessional and unwarranted to go from, wow, we just had a really bad weekend, let's get the OPP to come and police our jurisdiction to we just had a really bad weekend. Let's figure out how we need to get better and start to use everything we possibly can, and let's be as clear as we can but as quick as we can in requesting the things that we can reasonably anticipate we'll need in the short, medium and long term. Let's be very open to, as we have always been in Ottawa, even during my time, to integration. Nothing was off the table. I think I probably said that statement 453 times. Everything's on the table, including greater integration, and including unification.

12-175-02,"I'm not sure they wanted what you're suggesting Section 9. I never received any suggestion from Commissioners Carrique or Lucki that they wanted to come in here and bring the necessary lift of 2,000 plus officers, and have them on the ground here for days, if not weeks on end. I stand to be corrected if there's information out there that's different from that. Here's the challenge. Then you're going to have to get three levels of government to invest differently in three levels of policing. I don't know how the formula would work, but if we're to go down the what if scenario that you're asking me to entertain, and please, if the Commissioner doesn't have time for this or you want to move on, just let me know. But here's scenario number one: Take a percentage of every municipal police service, just say 10 percent, fold that up into the OPP because every single year some event is going to come to some municipal police service where they don't have enough resources, so automatically the OPP will get 10 percent cut of every police service because when, not if, they will be required under the new components of section 9 to come and take over policing for a day, a week, a month, they have the lift to be able to do that. I don't think any mayor or any regional authority is going to go for that, and I don't even think the Province would want that responsibility. Now, just layer in that on top of the RCMP. With how stretched they are with contract policing, national policing Indigenous policing, force protection internationally, there's probably eight functions that not one of them are staff adequately. Now are you going to take a 10-percent cut from the Provincial Police Services to allow the RCMP to do that? And now you come to the National Capital Region, where there are six police services operating in here at any given day. How do you divide the pie there? I understand the intellectual desire to explore that. The practical and financial side I'm sure merits the effort. I think what we need to do is get standards across the board, really clarify how and when we work together in integrated and/or unified, clarify the gaps between the Strategic, Operational, and Tactical, and how that fits into police of jurisdiction adequate and effective. That's going to be a lot cheaper and probably a lot faster, and it can be iterated over the course of time for lessons learned from experience to experience. You're talking about a major structural change, legislative change that would take years to hammer out and then years to get to a point of efficacy.",12-175-04,175,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-176-26,"Okay. Well, I think it was around 12 o'clock. Again, for context, if I get the dates wrong, I believe somewhere around the 6th or the 7th there was a communication between myself and Commissioner Carrique, where we had talked about a significant increase in integration. I forget who raised it, whether he did or I did, but we were very quickly in agreement that that would be very helpful and that we would need then to bring in folks from -- senior folks that had experience and expertise and that type of thing. He referenced Carson Pardy almost immediately. That name, I believe, came up in our first conversation, and I welcomed him and anybody else that he could send to support that. And to his word, I think within 24 hours we were contacted, 24 hours after that there was an initial meeting out at the RCMP Headquarters. That was a meeting, unfortunately -- I realise I'm going really fast, so I'm slowing myself down now. That was the meeting, unfortunately, that because of the distance to travel to and the Teams meetings problems that we had, Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson was only able to get a portion of her Incident Command staff on there. While there was somewhat of a productive discussion, it didn't get to the level where there was any substantive move forward. There was an agreement to have another meeting on the 9th of February, is that right, the 9th of February, and there was additional efforts during that period to continue to improve and evolve that plan. A substantive lift that day. I referenced earlier on that I got involved in that lift to try to elevate the plan to as great a degree as we possibly could for these partner agencies coming in. I believe around 12:00, 12:30, Chief Superintendent Pardy, Superintendent Abrams, RCMP Superintendent Lue, and I forget, there were other members, but those were the three primary members of the team, arrived at our headquarters.

The concept of the Hydra, if you can cut off the head and cauterise it, it can't grow back. If you can take a piece of ground and hold it, people can't come back.

I'm not sure of that next word: ""Asked if anyone needed clarification. Chief laid out his plan, omitted negotiation and when I brought it up he reacted angrily saying 'we are not negotiating', then said 'it's implicit'. I advised...""

Kevin Maloney. This meeting took place after an internal OPS planning meeting but before the February 9 12:10 p.m. meeting with Chief Superintendent Pardy and Superintendent Lue. His intent was to emphasize that the entire command team was signed off on the February 9 plan. At the meeting, he stated that he would ‘crush’ anyone who undermined the plan - Chief Sloly recognizes that it was an unfortunate choice of words but public safety, member health, wellness and safety, and the successful conclusion of the local Convoy event were all at a critical juncture and this required absolute command commitment to supporting the implementation of the updated plan. He restated the need for unity within the command to support the updated plan including the level of integration and the acquisition of the needed resources to safely and successfully end the events in Ottawa. There were to be no major changes to the plan, the concept of operations, the elevated integration and the senior ICS assignments without discussion about the need for such a change.” Does this reflect your recollection of what happened?",12-181-15,181,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

We are now bringing in a significant amount of resources, a significant level of integration, and we simply cannot have a individual make a change that could affect the strategic intent of what we were trying to accomplish at this point. We needed to have -- on the positive side, we needed to have a full commitment across the command team that we had reached a position now that could move forward with. There was still going to be evolutions of the plan and subplans and as resources became available, but that the base of the week and change of pivoting from where we were into this new position, particularly with the request of resources and integration, this required a very firm and full commitment from the command team going forward.",12-183-06,183,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-187-25,"Yeah, first of all, these are Trish’s -- Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson’s words. I won’t challenge her emotions or interpretation around it but they’re not the conversation that I was leading at this point. I had a very clear discussion about two elements. We are going to be assessed on our quality of our planning and the relevance to the resource requests and if we cannot provide enough substantive justification for what we’re looking for, we’re likely not going to get the level of help that we need. Secondarily, I did talk about the politics that are happening in and around this entire event. By this time, it is a national event with global coverage. By this time, I had had several interactions with all three levels of government and the board. It was clear to me that there was increasing intense and, in some cases, I believe, undeserved and unhelpful political pressures happening to the Ottawa Police Service, pressures that could affect our ability to secure the resources. So I was letting them be aware, giving them situational awareness and allowing a conversation to happen in a very tight room with my command team so they could have as much understanding before they went in front of the group of external agencies to have that conversation. I didn’t want there to be any surprises and I wanted them to be as fully informed as possible. An example would be the day before this there was a public motion put forward by a significant number of city councillors asking for the Ottawa Police Service to remove the police’s jurisdiction for the purposes of the incident command. So these were very live, real-time issues. There were others that they were less aware of.

One of those trilevel calls that you referenced with Rob Stewart and Commissioner Lucki, it was the only time that Ministers Mendocino and Blair were on the call, and I joined it late for some reason. I think I had multiple competing demands. And there was a question asked. Maybe it goes to what Commissioner Lucki was talking here about existing legislation, but a question was asked of me by Minister Blair, ""Have you considered doing by-law enforcement?"" Which I thought was a strange question. And I said, ""Yes, we've been doing by-law enforcement from the very beginning."" And then he asked a second question, ""Well, have you considered towing trucks?"" And I said, ""Yes, we've been towing trucks from the very beginning, but we don't have sufficient officers to do full enforcement and we don't have sufficient trucks to do extensive towing.""

12-204-28,"Okay. Now we began our discussions today with questions about the Ottawa Police Service at the time the convoy arrived. And now we're into -- well into February. I want to come back to the question of your confidence in the OPS team. On the day before your resignation on the 14th of February, we have this communication -- your communication with Chair Deans. If I could find the reference, could we go to OPS00014566, page 6? So this is a call on February the 14th. So if we scroll down a little, ""When asked by Chair if any of my orders were disobeyed during the demonstration, Chief advised there have been major issues with senior leadership team members but he has not had time to do an investigation on what has been going on here. The best and the worst of us have been strained - [that] is why there has been tense meetings and why some have not demonstrated their best [efforts].

12-205-24,"There was a discussion in there with the Chair around the quality of support that I was receiving inside the organization and my own sense of where we were at at the leadership level. A reasonable question from the Chair of the Police Services Board at the direct employee level that the Board has with myself, and in this case only Deputy Chief Bell because Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson was not an employee of the Board. And I gave my best answer to her, there were some challenges. I mean, I actually think these notes capture it well. I -- there would be elements of some of those leadership challenges that would need to be reviewed in an after-action report, again, I didn't have a chance to ever conduct that. And I had made decisions on the fly in the midst of this very fluid situation to address conduct issues and park them or address them and move on from them completely. But I also gave the caveat that there had been incredible levels of stress and fatigue, and that clearly no one, including myself, could claim that they were always operating in their best, at their best.",12-205-26,205,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

12-206-16,How did that lack of trust affect the leadership of the OPS during the convoy events in the sense did it make you more likely to step in and provide directions because you could not trust others to lead at the Strategic or Operational levels?,12-206-18,206,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-206-21,"No. It's an important question you're asking, and it's a -- not an easy question to answer. So please if you can give me some leeway here. There was a significant trust issue. That's the only significant trust issue that I was aware of and I thought had a material impact on the events that transpired over those weeks, was the switching out of Superintendent Rheaume for Superintendent Dunlop. And we've been through that, so I won't go back to it. When I realised what had happened, as close as I can, good discipline should be in the smallest -- small ""d"" discipline, should be applied as quickly to the event. I immediately called a meeting with the two Command Officers. I asked them a straight question, and to their credit they gave me straight answers. I wasn't happy with the answers, meaning I was disappointed that they had chosen to go that route, and I expressed that immediately and clearly. And then I counselled them immediately, and I told them what good behaviour would look like going forward, and then I moved on from it. And as I said earlier on, they both in their own ways worked back towards demonstrating trust and capability. What I was asked here was overall what's happening, and I related that circumstance, but there were other elements of a lack of cohesion within the team. People making assumptions. We've already elements of people taking a rumour and assuming it's truth and how that impacted a range of issues from PLT to whether or not there was a plan to whether or not the plan had been approved. So those were issues that I was dealing with on an ongoing basis. They were difficult issues to deal with. They took time and energy away from everybody involved, including me. And in some cases, they caused confusion. So those are the types of things I was trying to relate to the Chair, but I was also trying to relate the context in which we had found ourselves, unprecedented, uncharted, unrelenting pressures, inside the organisation and outside the organisation, to not leave with her with the impression that we were having some sort of a mass internal revolt. That was my understanding at that time, and that's what I tried to relay as honestly and as fully to the Chair at that time.",12-206-23,206,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
12-208-06,"Now, there are two other events I want to cover. So you had this conversation with Chair Deans on the 14th. I want to ask you about the 13th, as well as on the 15th. So let's start with the 13th. I'm skipping ahead. I jump a few things because in the interest of time. We've heard from the other witnesses, including Chief Pardy and Superintendent Bernier that Superintendent Bernier was working closely with the Integrated Planning Group as of the 12th, and by the 13th they have signed off on a plan, and we've seen the plan. There was an email that was exchanged on or around the 13th that I'd like to take you to so as to clarify what your understanding was as to the evolving plan that you described. Can I take you to OPP00001547. So if we go to the very bottom of the chain, this email chain originated from you to Deputy Chief Ferguson, you ask her to please send you the latest version of the Operations Plan that you approved on Wednesday, February 9th. That was the day when you met with the Integrated Planning Group that we talked about, and then you also ask: ""...to please advise if the plan has received official approvals/signatures/etc as there seems to be some concerns about this from the RCMP."" If we go up one level. So Deputy Chief Ferguson replied to you, saying: ""In checking with Rob Bernier, he finally had a chance to review the plan from the Integrated Planning team and has sent it back with his comments. He would prefer that it be completed and signed off and will then share the plan, as he is the final approver of it. As for version 3.0, Ottawa Truck Demo '22 [9th of February]...""

12-209-18,--- that as a -- as per your request. So we've heard from both Deputy Ferguson and from Superintendent Bernier. Superintendent Bernier was very clear that to him the 3.0 and the February 13th plan were very different plans. So I just want to get your comment on that.,12-209-20,209,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-209-24,"They were very different plans in that they were significantly more evolved.

FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
12-210-01,"So if we go one level up the email chain, you reply to Deputy Ferguson: ""Thank you for the clarification. I was not aware of this delay as I had approved the plan last Wednesday."" By ""last Wednesday"", that would've been the 9th. And I put this question to both Chief Pardy and Superintendent Bernier, I believe, and they disagree that you had approved any plan the previous Wednesday, in part because there was no plan to approve the previous Wednesday.",12-210-03,210,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
12-210-11,"And again, I understand the perspective of Chief Superintendent Pardy that he did not consider what we had presented to him as a plan. I disagree with that assessment. It may not have been to his standard or the OPP's standard, but it was the plan evolved since January 28th through several iterations, some of which we've seen here today, that was signed off by Inspector Lucas and Superintendent Rheaume, and continued through until the next signature blocks appeared on the February 13th version of the same plan. I can appreciate Chief Superintendent Pardy might not have known of the iterations that preceded it, he might not have understood our business processes and policies, and he might have assumed that this was a brand new plan. I'm also aware of an email from Superintendent Lue of the RCMP that shares my impression, that the February 9th plan was being used by the Integrated Planning Team to build on. And that is entirely my understanding. That is why when I sent the email to Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson, ""send me the latest version"", I wasn't talking about the February 9th plan. ""What was the latest iteration that had developed since then? I just need to see. Is there a new org chart? Have you got an updated mission statement? Have you got a better sense of objectives you want? Are there subplans that I should be looking at?"" I just needed an update. And I was having phone calls on a daily basis with Commissioners Carrique and Lucki in which there was these constant questions of ""Have you signed off on it?"", and I would respond, ""I don't sign off on the plans."" ""Well, we heard it's with you."" ""It's not with me. I haven't even been briefed on it yet."" ""Well, we've heard it's you that have to approve it."" ""I don't approve the plans."" I have to tell you we went around and around on that. And this is me trying to finally just say, ""Trish, whatever is the latest version send it to me. If it's been signed off, please send to me quickly so I can forward it to Carrique and to Lucki -- Commissioners Carrique and Lucki."" And that's exactly what I did at the end, I think somewhere around nine o'clock, I said, ""Here it is. You can see the signatures on it. It's Bernier, it's Lue"", sorry, I should use their ranks, ""Superintendent Lue, Chief Superintendent Pardy, and Acting Superintendent Bernier. It's signed off. It's done."" I never had to approve it, there's no signature line, it’s being implemented. I think there were still questions after that. I cannot, to this day, understand why there are still questions about whether or not the plan was approved and signed off. It had been approved. It had been signed off.",12-210-13,210,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
12-212-03,"Finally, I’d like to take you to the events of the 15th of February. That was the day you resigned.

FRANK AU,frank au
12-212-07,"I think we were well positioned. I wouldn’t say we had reached a position of certainty but we were well positioned. We had, at that point, a significant level of integration. We had received significant levels of resources including expertise, including experienced leaders of the quality of Chief Supt. Pardy, Supt. Lue, and others. I think at that time, we actually had the strongest of the different iterations of incident command teams with Acting Supt. Bernier as the event commander. I think at that point he had a deputy commander in OPP Insp. Springer. Both of them seemed to have a very good rapport. And Insp. Springer, I believe, was one of the most experienced and trained incident commanders, if not in the province, across the country and there really seemed to be a sense of structure to what they were doing, and they were building in position that, in my experience as an incident commander and the roles I played in Toronto Police, were very useful for us, and I can see how they were being applied here. So my sense was we had a strong and increasingly stronger plan, a strong and increasingly stronger level of integration, and finally, demonstrably, a greater level of resources coming. But it was that last area that I still that there was -- there were challenges in getting those resources.

So I don’t in any way challenge the notion that the change created a change but I do note that the level resources flowing was incredible at that point and that within three or four days there was sufficient resources on the ground to execute successfully the operations that have already been described in this court.",12-213-09,213,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

The public’s opinion, the opinion of three levels of government, opinions of civil society leaders, that I think unfairly and unnecessarily laid the blame of this thing on the Ottawa Police Service. We did our very best for as long as we could. We sought the resources and the help that we could. We integrated and implemented those resources, ultimately, successfully. But on the morning of February 15th, it was clear to me that the trust factor in Ottawa Police Service was still headed in the wrong direction and the only person that could take that pressure off the Ottawa Police Service was me and I made that decision to resign from office to get the resources on the ground to support the safety of our communities and, quite frankly, to support the safety to health and wellness of our own members and out partner agencies that were, at that point, in the theatre.",12-213-27,213,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

There could have been, though an injunction -- maybe there would be some way to engage other elements like insurance bureaus, hotels. Again, it’s not an area of expertise. I’m not a lawyer. I don’t believe I’ve actually been involved in the drafting and carrying through of an injection all the way.

12-229-04,"Fair enough. So I’ll take you OTT00029695, and this is an email from David White, City solicitor, to Steve Kanellakos, who’s the City Manager, and this was after his discussion with you, Mr. White’s call with you. He emailed the City Manager copying others at the City about the discussion that he had just had with you. So that’s the context for this email in case you haven’t had the chance to see it before. So he says: ""I just got off the call with Chief Sloly and his team that is coordinating the OPS response to the protest on the issue of an injunction."" So then he says, “This is what they’re looking for.” And then if we go to the second paragraph -- oh, third paragraph, excuse me: ""I also took the opportunity to explain to the chief that any request for an injunction would need to be founded in public safety concerns. While the OPS’ main concern seems to be around noise, traffic impacts, public frustration based on the idea that the police should be doing something about the protest, mounting costs, air pollution, et cetera, there does not yet seem to be significant violence associated with the event, nor much in the way of public safety concern…"" So I just want to pause there for a second.

I mean we’d seen -- we had seen massive public safety concerns across the downtown in the red zone. They were well-publicized on mainstream media and social media events of assaults, threatening behaviour, hate incidents. I don’t know how he would have taken the impression from us that these were just minor bylaw issues, public frustration, and who’s going to pay the bill. I suspect all those areas were part of our discussions but he would only have to look out of his window at City Hall to understand what was happening in our city at this time, a significant public safety event happening in our city.",12-230-10,230,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So on the one hand, we have the City being told that, you know, enforcing bylaws and any laws, really, was too dangerous for public safety issues, that there was the risk of violence, there was the risk of injury and death. And I can take you to some notes where that’s indicated. But on the other hand, the City was also told -- at least in this email, seems to have been told that there wasn’t much in terms of a public safety risk and we’ve seen, actually, from some EOCCG, which is the group that manages the emergency response on a municipal level -- that group was putting out updates every day and they used language such as “party-like atmosphere”, “it’s festive”.

I will say on the spectrum of million things we needed to get done in real time, this was probably in the middle to bottom half of it, so it is possible that the City was waiting for updates but everyone in the organization -- my organization was busy on higher priority items at that point.

12-234-07,"So this is the email of February 6. If we go to the first email of the thread -- right. And go up a little bit so we can see who it’s from. Yeah, right there. So it’s John Steinbachs from the OPS, and it’s to Chair Deans and the Mayor and others in Ottawa, and you as well. And if we go down, Chair Deans and Mayor Watson: “Please find below the list of Ottawa Police Service asks to the federal, provincial and municipal levels of government that was requested yesterday by the Board.” So as my colleague pointed out, on the 5th of February you were asked to provide a number of resources that you required as well as other requirements that you needed in order to bring this to an end. And if we go down, we see that you have some asks there from the City. And I wanted to just briefly ask you about a few of these, if we go down. Okay. So here -- and actually, this is an interesting question because I think we touched on it earlier but maybe didn’t get a clear answer. So it says there, “The Service requires 1,800 additional staffing and enforcement resources.” So this is, I think, the first reference that we see to the 1,800 ask. And this is on February 6th. I believe it’s at 4:07 p.m. There’s later a meeting that you have with Chair Deans and the Mayor in which you provide them that number as well, and then the following day you send them an email with a chart. You might recall that chart, and that was on February 7th. So the question was, you had been asked by the Board to come up with the number of resources that you required to end the protest on February 5th. And on February 6th at 4:30, you send this email. So at what point did you determine the number of additional resources you needed and how?

12-242-24,"That is why there’s clear documentation of me saying, “Are we ready to go? Have we thought about all the things we need to do? Have we considered whether we’re going to be closing more roads, more highway offramps, more bridges, based on what we learned from last weekend and what we’ve seen in other jurisdictions.” And I was really kicking the tires hard on that. And that is why on the third weekend, I issued my only direct order at the operational level: close the interprovincial bridges and close the highways that give direct access to the downtown core. I rescinded that only when the then incident commander, sorry, event commander, Rob Bernier, articulated a substantially robust traffic management plan to address the circumstances that were happening at that time. And it turned out to be a very successful plan. But that remained a significant concern for me and for the organization. There were more roads closed on the second weekend. There were more effective coordination around the interprovincial bridges. There was more assistance from the OPP on monitoring traffic around the King’s Highways.

12-247-20,"Thank you. The language used around the officers posing in photos are problematic to me. If I was not clear in my language, I'll accept that. I accept and adopt the views as relayed by Inspector Lucas. Officers will often have to do a fist bump or lean in for a selfie just to try to keep the temperature down in circumstances they're in. That is just the reality of almost any circumstance, any day, not even requiring something of this level, just in order to try to build rapport in a minute so to keep things at the right level or de-escalate things that could be escalating. And I'll always defer to an officer on that. In the broader sense, I could understand -- and maybe that’s where my comments were attributed -- in the broader sense, these photos that are being -- going viral on social media without proper context, would be extremely problematic and were extremely problematic. They were used extensively in the social media disinformation and misinformation campaigns, and unfortunately, crept into some of the mainstream media reporting as well. I think it's more in that context that I would be talking about it as opposed to every single officer I saw in a photograph doing a fist bump or a thumbs up was unacceptable. That’s never been my experience, and I would have done the same things and had done the same things throughout my policing career, and wouldn't expect to be sanctioned by a superior officer if they took the time to find out as to why I was doing it.",12-247-22,247,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

They had hours with the Service Sergeant Major to ask any questions that they wanted.

I think each one of my recommendations could probably fill another 20 pages or so, but I just think for the time here I'll leave it there and make myself available to you.",12-279-08,279,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Because ultimately, I think we know it's been stressful, but I think we're doing a not bad job. Certainly the -- I'm very impressed with everyone's work so far.

22-008-13,"Good morning, Mr. Commissioner. Nusra Khan, Commission counsel. I’ll just wait for the PowerPoint to be pulled up on the screen there. Okay, perfect. So I’ll be presenting the overview report titled “Federal Government Entities Involved in the Decision to Invoke the Emergencies Act”. This overview report is now available to the parties om the party database and will be posted on the Commission’s web site for the public very shortly. The document ID for this report is COM.OR00000008. Next slide, please. By way of introduction, this presentation focuses on the mandates of three key federal entities, that is, the Federal Executive, the Prime Minister, Cabinet and the Governor in Council, the Privy Council Office and the Prime Minister’s Office. Of course, there were many other departments and agencies implicated in the decision to declare a Public Order emergency, and the Commissioner will hear from evidence -- will hear evidence from these witnesses in the coming two weeks. The purpose of this overview report is to contextualize and frame the anticipate evidence for the benefit of the parties, the public and, of course, the Commissioner. Next slide, please. So we’ll begin with the definition. Section 17(1) of the Emergencies Act designs the formal authority to declare the existence of a Public Order emergency to the Governor in Council. The term “Governor in Council” refers to the Governor-General of Canada acting on the advice of the King’s Privy Council for Canada. The King’s Privy Council, in turn, is a technical term that describes the full group of people who have the authority to advise the sovereign or the Governor-General acting as the representative of the sovereign. In practical terms, however, references to the King’s Privy Council are references to the Federal Cabinet. The Federal Cabinet is a committee of the Privy Council and is effectively its only operative branch. And by constitutional convention, the Governor- General is required to follow the advice given by Cabinet. This is, of course, a fundamental part of our system of responsible government. Next slide, please. So here we have an organizational chart depicting the structure of the Federal Executive Branch. You’ll see that while the formal authority to govern is vested in the Governor- General, that authority is exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. In turn, Prime Minister and Cabinet are supported by two central offices: the Privy Council Office and the Prime Minister’s Office. So to put it into context, the four Orders in Council that were issued by the Governor in Council in the context of the Public Order emergency were issued on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Next slide. Thanks. The Federal Cabinet is a political decision- making body that consists of all Federal Ministers as well as the Prime Minister. The Cabinet is sometimes referred to as the Federal Ministry. Cabinet is the forum wherein the government of the day sets its priorities and decides how to advance these priorities. The Prime Minister sets the agenda and will lead Ministers to agreement in making Cabinet decisions, but the final and ultimate decision-making authority rests with the Prime Minister. Cabinet members are governed by two related conventions, Cabinet solidarity and Cabinet confidentiality. Cabinet solidarity requires that Ministers as a group be held accountable to Parliament for their government’s actions. Cabinet confidentiality requires that Ministers not disclose the substance of their Cabinet discussions to the public. The two principles are, of course, intertwined because Cabinet confidentiality allows Ministers to frankly and vigorously discuss their views with their colleagues in private while remaining united in their decisions to the public. Ministers are also individually responsible for the federal departments they oversee. The powers and duties in respect of their departments are set out in their departmental statutes. In practice, however, the day-to-day operations of a federal department or agency are carried out by the Deputy Minister and civil servants. A Deputy Minister is the senior-most member of the professional non-partisan public service. Finally, every Minister is supported by a Ministerial Office consisting of a political staff in carrying out their duties as members of Parliament. Political staff are sometimes referred to as exempt staff because they are not bound by the strict impartiality rules that apply to the public service and are, instead, temporary political appointees. So there’s a clear separation between political staff and the public servants who work with in federal departments in that political staff do not have the authority to give direction or instruction to public servants. Next slide, please. So here we have another organizational chart that depicts the work of Cabinet and Cabinet committees. The work of the government is also carried out by several Cabinet committees. The protests and the government’s response to the protests were discussed by two Cabinet committees in particular. The first was the Cabinet Committee on Safety, Security and Emergencies, or SSE, which was chaired by the Minister of Emergency Preparedness. The SSE met on February 3rd, 6th and 8th. The second Cabinet committee was the Incident Response Group, or IRG. The IRG took over the management of the issue after February 8th and was chaired by the Prime Minister and, therefore, had decision-making authority. The IRG met on February 10th, 12th and 13th, and then daily thereafter between February 16th and February 23rd. I will also add that there were two full Cabinet meetings at which the protests and the invocation of the Emergencies Act was discussed. These meetings took place on February 3rd and February 15th. Turning now to the Prime Minister’s Office, the PMO is a central political agency supporting the Prime Minister in his three roles as the head of government, the leader of a political party and a Member of Parliament. PMO staff advise the Prime Minister on policy issues, communications and Parliamentary affairs, and PMP is led by a Chief of Staff who reports directly to the Prime Minister and is also appointed by the Prime Minister. Like the staff at Ministerial offices, all staff at the PMO are exempt staff in that they are temporary political appointees. The PMO operates as a critical link between the partisan interests and agenda of the Prime Minister and the general workings of government. For instance, PMO maintains close relationships with political staff at Ministers’ offices as well as with officials at the Privy Council Office, and PMO officials often attend Cabinet meetings. The Privy Council Office, or PCO, is the central coordinating agency within the federal government. And in contrast to PMO, the PCO provides non-partisan advice to the Prime Minister and Cabinet and ensures that the government’s agenda is implemented across all federal departments and agencies. And for this reason, PCO is sometimes referred to as the Prime Minister’s Department. PCO is led by the clerk of the Privy Council. The clerk holds the additional titles of the Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister, the Secretary to Cabinet and the Head of the Public Service. And as a Secretary to Cabinet, the clerk is responsible for the smooth operation of Cabinet business, including the preparation of Cabinet memoranda and the keeping of Cabinet confidences. In addition to its primary role as the central coordinating agency, PCO also serves as the department for some Ministers. This includes the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who is supported by the Intergovernmental Affairs Secretariat, as well as the Minister of Emergency Preparedness, who is supported the Emergency Preparedness and COVID-19 Recovery Secretariat. Another important PCO actor is the National Security and Intelligence Advisor, or the NSIA. The NSIA holds the title of Deputy Secretary to Cabinet and provides national security advice and intelligence briefings to the Prime Minister, as well as to Cabinet. The Office of the NSIA plays a coordinating and convening function amongst national security agencies and the Office of the NSIA itself consists of four secretariats and is responsible for convening two standing committees of senior civil servants. The NSIA also acts as the Secretary to the Incident Response Group. So this chart depicts the relationship between the Privy Council Office, federal departments and agencies, and the various secretariats within PCO. It should be noted that there is no legislation governing the role of the NSAI or PCO, as these entities are meant to play only an advisory, secretarial, and coordination function to Cabinet. The NSAI chairs the Deputy Minister’s Operations and Coordination Committee, or DMOCC, and the Assistant Secretary to Cabinet Security and Intelligence cochairs the Assistant Deputy Minister’s Committee on National Security and Operations, or ADMNSOPs. Both the ADMNSOPs and DMOCC met frequently, in fact almost daily, in late January and throughout February 2022 to discuss the government’s response to the protests. Finally, the departments and agencies listed on this slide were also involved in the Federal Government’s response to the protests and blockades and the decision to invoke the Emergencies Act. And as I mentioned earlier, witnesses from each of these departments are expected to testify in the coming weeks, and I would invite the parties to consult the Institutional Reports prepared by each department for a fuller explanation of the Department’s mandate and involvement. So that concludes the presentation on this overview report. But before I go, I would also like to enter three additional overview reports prepared by Commission Counsel and that I understand the parties have had the chance to review.

Those threats can emanate from -- and indeed, we have an elaborate control system across Canada. We have export controls, we have the Investment Canada Act. We have a series of tools, but the Economic Security Task Force was looking at whether or not those tools were fit to purpose and, indeed, whether that tool set was adequate in order to protect ourselves against the threats of today.

22-024-04,"I would describe my role specifically having gone through the five Directorates in my branch. The one Directorate in particular, the National Security Operations Directorate, through that Directorate I have a responsibility -- and I’ll refer to the presentation that was given to us this morning where we highlighted the Privy Council Office and its role. With the Privy Council Office, they have a Security and Intelligence Secretariat. The assistant secretary responsible for that secretariat and I have a responsibility of convening the security and intelligence community, which is some 16 departments and agencies, on a regular basis to discuss ongoing operational national security matters for situational awareness and, indeed, to be able to make sure that we’re coordinating with community to be able to respond to potential threats to national security. So that particular committee is called the Assistant Deputy Minister National Security Operations Committee, ADMNSOPs, if you don’t mind me that acronym. I’ll probably refer to that a lot. So ADMNSOPs meets every week, once a week. During the convoy situation, I would say that the regular meeting on Tuesday, January 25th we discussed the convoy, but after that date, we decided to have ad hoc meetings, so every day, daily meetings of that committee pretty much throughout the rest of the operational situation, if I could put it that way. So I guess my role primarily was to convene along with my PCO colleague, the Privy Council Office colleague, all the various representatives of these departments and agencies in the security and intelligence community. And I’m happy to walk you through who they might be. But we would get together and discuss whether or not this issue was an issue of national security and whether or not it could lead to threats to national security.",22-024-06,24,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Well, you’ve anticipated essentially my next question because the first sort of broad topic that I think we’re going to cover here is public safety’s preparation for the convoy, and that feeds into, Mr. Rochon, what you were telling us about public safety’s intelligence role. So at this point I’ll ask you to, I guess, please explain that and explain how it was -- how it fed into public safety’s preparation.",22-025-18,25,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-025-25,"So I’ll start by explaining that intelligence with regard to the federal family, you have collectors of intelligence, you have assessors of intelligence and you have consumers of intelligence. Public Safety Department is a consumer. We don’t per se collect intelligence and we don’t assess intelligence. We consume it. Why does one consume intelligence? In order to be able to be better informed so that decisions -- so that decisions can be made. And those decisions are made across all departments and agencies. The key collectors of intelligence, CSIS, the Communications Security Establishment, CBSA to a certain extent, what they collect and what they see at the border, RCMP, but indeed, beyond the federal family, there’s also collection of intelligence that occurs within police of jurisdiction, which I’m sure you would have heard about it, municipal level, at the provincial level, et cetera. Intelligence is -- can be very broad. It’s not an exact science, and really only provides a piece of information at a moment in time. The federal family also has assessors of that intelligence, which means they pull different threads of intelligence together in order to be able to fuse it and provide a more holistic picture to again better inform potential decisions related to national security matters. Assessors are the Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre, ITAC. You have the Privy Council Office also has a secretariat, the Intelligence Assessment Secretariat, but to a certain extent, CSIS, the Communications Security Establishment, perform their own assessments and are able to provide reports, as does the RCMP. When we convene the ADMNSOPs group, typically we will use different pieces of intelligence in order to be able to inform us on various issues that are happening all over the world that could lead to or are posing a threat to national security. So throughout the particular situation with the convoy, I would say that there was some intelligence that was likely being pulled together at a police of jurisdiction level. That isn't something that would make its way to our federal family table as a matter of course. The RCMP sits at that table and would bring any information that they would learn, as they're stitched up with different police of jurisdiction across the country, they would bring that information to the table if there was something relevant that needed to be flagged. But there is a distinction between something rising to (a), national security level, and something that is a police matter that they might be dealing with throughout the country.",22-025-27,25,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-027-17,"Okay. And in your interview -- we're going to go back to some of that as we go along, but you explained that prior to the convoy's arrival -- this is taking you up on your last point -- NCSB, so the National Cyber Security Branch, wasn't gathering or dissemination intelligence about the convoy because, at that point, there was no indication that the events would be a national security threat. So can you explain and elaborate on that a little bit, what that threshold is and when, if at all, NCSB did start doing that and why?",22-027-19,27,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
22-027-27,"So, again, our branch does not collect intelligence. We're consumers of it. So we would be receiving that intelligence from different parties, be it CSIS or be it the RCMP in the federal family context. The Government Operations Centre is another element of Public Safety. They fall under the Emergency Management Branch. They don't fall under my branch. Nevertheless, the Government Operations Centre, otherwise known as the GOC, does have a role to play with regard to any potential emergency in terms of pulling together information and disseminating that information about a potential emergency. They're a 24/7 OP Centre at Public Safety. So the reason I mention them is, obviously, if there is a potential protest -- or, for example, on Canada Day when there are provisions that need to be made in terms of securing a particular area, or if there's a potential threat that may be arising, the Government Operations Centre does start collecting open source information and sharing that information across the federal security and intelligence community in order for there to be situational awareness about a potential for social disruption or something that may be of concern. So I would say the GOC was aware, and within Public Safety would have been the first entity that would have started collecting information. I think that the weekend before the convoy decided to make its way to Ottawa, they would have started collecting some information and disseminating it. Following that, Transport Canada, obviously given their mandate, would have started having concerns about slow rolls and disruptions to traffic. And the member of Transport Canada that is a member of the ADM in this OPs, Kevin Brousseau, would have called both Mike MacDonald and I to say that he wanted to make sure that the issue was brought to the attention of the ADMNSOPs Committee because it did have the potential of rising to a national security level given the fact that this was happening across Canada.",22-027-29,27,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Mr. Clerk, could you please pull up TRN0000011? So this is an excerpt from a transcript of Commissioner Carrique's evidence from a couple of weeks ago. I'll set the context for you and then I'll ask you to maybe elaborate a bit on what he was discussing. So the reference is page 90, and just pull that up. So the context here is Commissioner Carrique was being questioned by my colleague Mr. Brousseau about a reference in an OPP Hendon report, and I'll just stop there. In the interview -- the Commission's heard quite a bit of evidence about Project Hendon and OPP's Hendon reports. And in the interview that we had in September, you told us that neither of you had heard of Project Hendon at the time specifically and that the Project Hendon reports hadn't been fed up to you. And I take it that that goes to your point of provincial law enforcement intelligence would likely not be directly fed up to you, but I'm wondering if you can -- or if it did, it would be through the RCMP.

And if there's a particular incident that is occurring, they will pull together a particular operation and start collecting information, intelligence about that particular issue. So I'm assuming here, in this case, that the Ontario Provincial Police will have -- would have started Operation Hendon. Now police of jurisdiction will get together and liaise with the RCMP, so I would be -- I am quite certain that the RCMP would have been privy to anything coming out of Project Hendon, as they would have been privy to anything coming out of the Ottawa Police Service and other police of jurisdiction across Ontario or indeed across Canada. And for the purposes of our National Security Committee that looks at operational situations, the RCMP would be feeding us any relevant information, but they would not be referring to an Operation Hendon or an operation -- whatever the various operations.

Carrique says: “What is required is further analysis of that threat, Hendon...did have those conversations with the appropriate security partners...to see if that potential threat rose to the point that would warrant them enacting their mandates for the items...they’re responsible for. And...as we know, [slow down]... It in the CSIS Act, it says [threat to the secure -- or] it says ‘the security of Canada.’ doesn’t actually say national security. Public Safety Canada goes to a much broader context when describing national security, and one of the items in national security, if you look at the national security strategy and how it’s described by Public Safety Canada, actually includes impact to economy, activities at critical infrastructures, international border crossings.” So Mr. Rochon or Mr. Stewart, whoever’s best placed to answer this, can you explain and elaborate a little bit on what Comm. Carrique is referring to here; Public Safety Canada’s national security strategy and definition?",22-033-23,33,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
22-034-21,"I’ll give it a go. To be honest, the national security strategy dates back to 2004. And there are several academic institutions as of late that have recommended that the Government of Canada come out with a more -- a newer version, or at least refresh that strategy. I’ll start by explaining what was meant in terms of CSIS and whether or not the threshold was met with regard to their Act. What that -- what I think Comm. Carrique was referring to was the fact that, as I was mentioning earlier, CSIS has the ability to collect intelligence, but they can only collect intelligence if certain thresholds have been met. CSIS are only but one of a number of inputs into the national security landscape. And so they do have targets, whether it be -- and I’ll use a term here that I’m sure is going to come up, or probably already has come up that will come up fairly frequently, that of ideologically motivated violent extremism. Public Safety also has a counterterrorism strategy; we have a cybersecurity strategy; we’re developing an economic security strategy, as I mentioned earlier. We’re looking to create a hostile activities of state actors’ framework to deal with foreign interference. So the reason why we don’t have a -- perhaps an up-to-date national security strategy is because national security now permeates a whole host of things, all walks of life in terms of Canadian society. And I won’t even get into threats posed by climate change; indeed, the pandemic itself, the Public Health situation. Unfortunately, there is no -- as far as I know, no definition in legislation of national security. CSIS does have a definition of threats to the security of Canada. I believe the Security of Canada’s Information Disclosure Act, SCIDA, also speaks to a definition of threats and security of Canada. We have review bodies for the security and intelligence community: the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency, the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians; NSIRA and NSICOP. They have gone to great pains to sort of define what their purview is, in terms of national security. And indeed it covers, as I mentioned earlier, some 16 departments and agencies. So when it comes to national security, we’re not necessarily looking at one specific threat, a terrorism threat, but rather the impact on Canada’s ability to maintain the security of its institutions, its democracy, its people, its economy, the resilience of all of these things.",22-034-23,34,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And we started getting word of the convoy’s formation on around January 20th, and were, through the GOC and its connection to planning and coordination groups, and one in particular called Intersect, which is a group that brings together all the police of the region and various other entities that have an interest in the security of the national capital.

And so from the critical infrastructure perspective, and this is really why GOC was involved, is to make sure that we were mindful that there could be impacts to critical infrastructure. And as a result, you were being watchful.

And we were starting to see slow roll convoys in other places in the country, and as Dominic has said, we were concerned that this movement would grow and it wouldn’t be just a one time only event, that this would, in the end, manifest across the country in various places. And I believe right by the end of January, we were starting to see the blockade in the Coutts Port of Entry.

And as we know now, that didn’t happen. And it didn’t end after the weekend. Some trucks stayed. Many protestors stayed. So the next sort of topic I want to address is, very broadly, how did the Federal Government respond? Let’s start by talking -- we know that there were a variety of committees struck and calls and meetings taking place.

22-041-23,"All right. So we’ve established that prior to the convoy’s arrival in Ottawa, there were discussions taking place in the regular fora, which included the Deputy Minister’s Operational and Coordination Committee, and bilateral discussions across departments, including transport, to just take stock, basically, and make sure we had situational awareness. And I believe PCO officials would have been informing political officials at their end. We were certainly keeping the Minister apprised in his office. As the weekend progressed and it became clear that the convoy was intending to stay and the original thinking was that they would only stay a couple of days, and then it gradually morphed into an extended period of time, we ramped up the internal discussions and started to have a regular briefing on a daily basis of a small group of Ministers, including the Minister of Public Safety and the Minister of Emergency Preparedness, quite often the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Intergovernmental affairs as well, and occasionally the Minister of Justice. So these were key Ministers in the context of the protests. And they were -- they -- we started daily briefings of that group at the beginning of the first week after the weekend. And they were supported by regular daily meetings of the DMOCC, Deputy Ministers Operational Committee -- Coordination Committee meetings, as well as other discussions that we were having, and that goes outside of government, but with other officials around the country.

I'm sure we’ll come back to that.

I’ve referred earlier to its kind of organic nature, the uncertainty that prevailed, the sense of, quite frankly, menace that was starting to manifest itself. And given that it was happening on a national basis, Ministers were actively, to the best of my knowledge, talking to counterparts across the country and trying to bring things -- bring powers and plans to the table. It’s important to note, I think, at least for the record, that at no time did anybody start to think about instructing police to do anything, but they were very interested in what the plans of the police were in various parts of the country and as well, you know, how we would mobilize, you know, for border crossings with the Canadian Border Service Agency and local -- local police. So the sense here that, you know, there was a growing set of protests occurring, that it was taxing the abilities of local authorities to manage or to address them and the lack of, at that point in time, a particular sort of coordinated federal-provincial approach, that was what I was referring to.",22-048-10,48,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Rob Stewart posed the following question to Chief Peter Sloly, “What is the nature of the support that Ottawa is likely going to ask for?”. And it says here: “Note Rob Stewart was trying to understand in unsaid terms whether the OPS will directly request non-law enforcement assistance.” Can you tell us a little bit about what was going on there?",22-049-06,49,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-049-18,"Well, I didn’t take these minutes and I don’t think that’s accurate. The Chief -- Chief Sloly was saying very openly, almost right from the beginning after the weekend, that he needed more resources. And fairly early on, the RCMP did add resources to help the Ottawa Police and the number was quite a bit lower than Chief Sloly was asking for, so we weren’t entirely clear as to what exactly he needed in terms of the type of resources, and here we’re talking about policing resources. I had already spoken to the City, and here I mean City Manager Steve Kanalokos, and clarified that the federal government had no intention of mobilizing the Canadian Armed Forces to deal with the protests. And so it was not -- it really, I think, is subject of discussion at that time and the issue was more just the scope and nature of the policing resources that the city was calling for.",22-049-20,49,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-050-11,"Well, Chief Sloly and I think the -- the document does give some clarity to this, was reporting on what the Ottawa Police Service was trying to do to limit and contain the protests and there had been, for instance, a kind of a shack erected in one of the parks, federal parks, which was causing quite a lot of heartburn in that the police were successful in negotiating being taken down. It was storing gas and was actually, I think, a barbecue stand. But that was, as an example, one of the things that, you know, Chief Sloly was reporting on the police having achieved. And you know, he was projecting a sense of intention that, you know, they were going to continue, the Ottawa Police, to the best of their ability with the resources that they had stretched as they were to take steps to interdict and to disrupt the protest. And so this is what that question gets at, is what are your plans in the short run to do that kind of thing. It wasn’t -- it wasn’t -- this is not predicated on that kind of thing. It wasn’t -- it wasn’t this is not predicated on, at that point in time, the expectation that the Ottawa Police would be able to actually bring the protests to an end.",22-050-13,50,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Mr. Di Tommaso when he was here last week, the transcript reference for this is TRN0000021, page 262, testified that he understood this comment to mean that Ms. Thomas was trying to have the federal government wanting -- or this comment indicated that the federal government was wanting to wash its hands of the entire thing.

And so it wasn't predicated -- the question I don't believe was predicated on the federal government is looking to not take action. In fact, it was the opposite. I believe that the concern here was that the province was not taking as much action as they might be taking. And I want to caveat that by saying that at no time did I think the OPP was not rising to the -- to deal with the event. Their response was, as far as I was aware and through the Commissioner of the RCMP, what it should be in terms of coming to the city and participating in planning and response. So -- and Mr. Di Tommaso, in my conversation with him, of which there were many, was always assuring me that the OPP was on the job, and this pertained to Ottawa, it pertained to Windsor, it pertained to other places in the province where slow roll protests occurred.

Mr. Clerk, can I just ask you to pull up WTS0000066? This is your witness summary. I'd like to refer directly to some of the things you said in our interview. Okay. If we can go to page 17? There we go. So in the interview you said, ""...it was never clear whether the Government of Ontario was willing to assist Ottawa."" And you noted the Mayor of Ottawa, in your recollection, was frustrated. And then you added, ""...there was a question about how quickly the provincial government would endorse the OPP and whether it would put its weight behind the OPP..."" And then I think you just answered that the OPP was fully behind this. But then you noted, ""There is a misconception that in the normal course, protests in Ottawa are not a provincial issue, but rather [they're] dealt with by a combination of federal and local police. As he explained it, [he being you,] they were treating Ottawa as Washington, DC"" Can you explain what you meant by that, they were treating Ottawa as Washington, DC, and sort of walk us through what your viewpoint was in the early days in February of attempting to deal with the situation on behalf of the federal government and the response you were getting from Ontario.",22-053-17,53,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-054-21,"So in the normal course, the OPP does not come to Ottawa to deal with small-scale protests or Canada Day or any other major event. That tends to be coordinated -- that's within the scope and capacity of the Ottawa Police Service and it tends to be coordinated with the RCMP, who have responsibilities in the jurisdiction, as I've said before, for protecting Ministers and federal -- certain federal sites, and also the Parliamentary Protective Service, who have the responsibility of protecting the precinct, the Parliamentary Precinct. So those would be the people who would normally, you know, coordinate around the kinds of events that have occurred in the past, where the scale of the protest is not major. Here, we were talking about a situation where it had clearly gotten out of control and had become illegal. And notwithstanding that the Ottawa Police were being backstopped by the OPP and the RCMP, there was clearly more that needed to be done and ultimately was, to add, you know, rules and powers to address the situation. And this was lurking in the background on all the calls that we had with Ministers is where's Ontario. And the technical point that I think should be made here though is -- and I believe Mr. Di Tommaso touched on this. You know, municipalities are creatures of provinces. And under the law, if the Ottawa Police Service is in need of assistance, technically, they should be asking the OPP first and not the RCMP. That's according to the law. This isn't normal course, and indeed, it wouldn't be the RCMP's -- I believe it would not be the RCMP's position that they wouldn't do anything if Ottawa needed help. Police come to the help of each other all the time. But this issue here of Ottawa turning to the federal government, and asking for RCMP, and not really articulating, you know, how many more OPP they needed I think was also kind of a question that was floating around in the background.",22-054-23,54,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So in other words, as I understand it, I'm not a police official, you know, there are different skillsets the police have, and one of the skillsets, or one of the types of policing units that was necessary in both Ottawa and Windsor was Public Order Units, who wear, you know, who wear the helmets and carry the batons.

22-059-27,"--- in various jurisdictions, but that's what their responsibility is. And this -- the purpose of this call was to share, as I've mentioned, information, you know, help people come to terms with what was going on, make plans in their own jurisdictions. And as we know, police of jurisdiction across the country learned very quickly, but there was still the broader issue of why are these protests happening, and what can we do to de-escalate them. So the Director of CSIS had been reporting fairly consistently that in terms of the threshold for monitoring under the CSIS Act, he was not observing any increase in activity or any evidence of plans, and this is, to be clear here, a very high threshold. CSIS -- and my colleague Mr. Rochon can explain this in more detail if you wish -- can only monitor people that they believe to be of certain threats to the security of Canada, and that's a high bar for them. And so they're -- it's not a very large number of people that they're monitoring. It's quite small. It does not, as a general matter, include the population or large elements of the population. They are very targeted in their activities. So in that context, given their targets, they were reporting they were not seeing any activity on the part of those targets. And that's what I was reporting there. And then the simple observation that on the ground in Ottawa, things were kind of chaotic. We didn't have the evidence of planning, weren't hearing about planning, and no sense of extremism in the violent sense, although there was plenty of criminality by that point.",22-059-29,59,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-060-27,"Okay.

22-061-04,"Well, in this particular case it, again, refers to extremist elements. So from a terrorism perspective, I had mentioned earlier the ideologically motivated violent extremism, which is something that CSIS is coming to grips with, and indeed, have provided language in and around defining that, because historically, I would say, individuals are influenced by a singular definable belief system. And that's how we used to treat terrorism. There's been an evolution with regard to terrorism as of late. Now there is a confluence of a whole series of grievances that can come to bear, and it becomes a lot more difficult to track exactly how a particular threat can manifest itself in this IMVE environment. So there are xenophobic violence, anti-authority violence, gender-driven violence, other grievances that CSIS now have to wrap their minds around, how do we go after and collect information to protect Canadians against these emerging threats, when it can -- as opposed to a, as I mentioned earlier, a believe system where there is a clear head and a org structure behind a particular organization. In today's world now, we're seeing more and more that a lone wolf, a lone actor can actually perpetrate a particular extremist violent event. Nevertheless, the tools at our disposal and at CSIS's disposal is very much the CSIS Act that was written in 1984. And there is part 2C of the CSIS Act, or indeed part 2 of the CSIS Act gives 4 different distinctions as to what they can collect intelligence on, and it describes threats to the security of Canada. So in this particular instance, what we were referring to, as you can appreciate, federal provinces and -- or sorry, provinces and territories, representatives would be under the impression that federal government is sitting on a treasure trove of classified intelligence. And based on that intelligence, they would want to know, are we seeing something from an intelligence perspective that would show that these protests are organized and that, ultimately, they constitute an extremist threat to overthrow the government or something to that effect. So specifically, with regard to that extremist element, what we were saying here, or what the Deputy was referring to here is that as of yet, CSIS has not met a threshold to cause them to collect additional intelligence on a broader set of Canadians because they had not seen evidence of that. That being said, I should just also qualify that that doesn't mean that they weren't monitoring certain extremist targets of theirs that have met that threshold and seeing whether or not they were interested. And I also want to qualify a comment that I might have made earlier, intelligence, again, is not an exact science, and it's not foolproof. So just because you have a piece of evidence, or a piece of intelligence rather, doesn't mean that you have the full picture. And it becomes a very difficult mosaic to try and pull together in terms of pulling together intelligence emanating from CSIS, emanating from police forces, emanating from Canada Border Services Agency, pulling that picture together to determine whether there's a national security threat is a different proposition than indicating whether or not CSIS specifically had evidence of a violent extremism meeting their threshold.",22-061-06,61,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Police including rcmp and outside of Ottawa have supported […] Have strayed [I think that’s probably stayed] in close touch.

So here, you know, as an example, and as you said, Mr. Keenan -- Deputy Minister Keenan can speak to this, you know, we’re talking about deregistering a commercial vehicle, making it unable to be used for, you know, commerce. Not renewing license. Or various other ideas that were being floated around that we could do -- we could use at the Transport level, Transport authority level, that would have some effect.

22-067-02,"Okay. Before we get there, there’s another topic I’d like to ask you about, which is requests for federal assistance. So this again falls within the rubric of what was going on between the provinces, municipalities, and the Federal Government at the time. So request for federal assistance. I understand that that’s a responsibility that falls to the GOC. So can I ask you -- to an extent, at least -- be processed through the GOC, if I can put it that way. Can you explain, Deputy Minister Stewart, how that process works?",22-067-04,67,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
22-067-12,"So it’s under the Emergency Management Act and a responsibility of the Department, and then that’s delegated to the Government Operation Centre to coordinate. And the Government Operation Centre, for the record, is a coordination unit, a surveillance and coordination unit. It doesn’t have powers. It doesn’t have authorities. It just works to bring partners to the table. So an RFA is, in essence, a situation in which the provincial capacity to deal with an issue or -- yeah, it’s the provincial and territorial capacity to deal with an issue has been surpassed and they need federal assistance. And the role of the GOC is to discuss the request and to coordinate the response. They occur most frequently in the world of, you know, natural events, fires, floods, but there were many in the context of the pandemic as well. In fact, there were, I think, well over 190 in the last two and a half years or so, which is way, way beyond the normal level. In the context of the protests, there were only three. And some of them can be very routine. So one of -- the first one was for to use a federal space, the Cartier Drill Hall to park police vehicles. And that was just -- that’s a federal land, it needed permission granted. There was also an RFA from the Parliamentary Protective Service at one point in time to make sure that they could be supplied with food and support in the event that they were barricaded in due to police enforcement. So those are two RFAs that occurred. The main RFA that I think is of note is the one that came in from Alberta. And that one did not follow the normal course. The normal coruse for an RFA is for it be flagged by a provincial emergency authority to the GOC, allows for some back and forth about, you know, is this possible? Can we meet this need? And how are we going to respond to this? And, you know, that just smooths and expedites the process. In this case, it came in by letter from an Alberta Minister directly to a Federal Minister, and we had no forewarning of its appearance. So do you want me to further explain that?",22-067-14,67,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,DM ROBERT STEWART,dm. robert stewart

SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
22-069-04,"Yes. So background. This is with respect to the situation in Coutts. The RCMP is the police of jurisdiction and were, you know, faced with a problem of getting the trucks off the border crossing and the highway, and the absence of tow trucks. And in a general sense, it was a feature of these protests across the country, and particularly where they manifested as encampments, that the local tow truck industry would refuse to provide service, ostensibly due to threats to their livelihood. So this letter came in. It, as you said, came a bit out of the blue. It wasn’t hard to understand why the request was being made. And the question became, you know, is this a RFA that we can address. And, you know, two issues surfaced. One was whether we had the resources, and that would be, in effect, the towing equipment of the Armed Forces. You know, they have a base in Edmonton quite a long way from the border, and it has equipment to tow heavy vehicles. However, there's a very limited number of those units I understand, and moreover, they were not of the same type as heavy lift tow trucks and would have, had they been used, likely damaged the trucks they towed. So the general conclusion was that the resources of the Canadian Armed Forces were not appropriate to the task. And of course, we didn't have any other tow trucks elsewhere. The other issue that surfaced was whether the province had exhausted its authorities. And here, I note that the province had a Critical Infrastructure Defence Act, which gave them the power to command tow truck industry, as we did with the Emergencies Act, and that had not been used. So for both of those reasons, we signalled that we would not be meeting this RFA, although we bore it very much in mind. It's when we formulated the orders under the Emergencies Act.",22-069-06,69,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,DM ROBERT STEWART,dm. robert stewart

And that conversation was a situational update. We were -- we explained, and the National Security Intelligence Advisor provided some insight into the thinking in Canada around what we were doing and how we intended to address the protests. The White House official offered support, you know, whatever they could think of, and in particular, say tow trucks from Detroit. So that was that call. There were subsequent calls.

And so I was brought in. I don't have the date off the top of my head, but I was brought in I think the week of February 10th. During that week, I provided a brief to her and some of her officials in terms of the situation happening in Canada and whether or not we had any -- how we were coping with the potential threat to national security. And similarly, obviously, on her side of the border, you know, following -- the year prior with the January 6th capital event, they still had potential extremist elements and there was also the possibility of convoys happening in and around various activities happening in Washington.

The Deputy Minister stated that the view of the Ottawa Police is that they will not be able to bring the protest to a conclusion without the assistance of the federal government due to concerns for public safety. There is a risk that increased enforcement will provoke some protesters. There is work being done by the city on an injunction however, there is no timing on if and when it could be issued. Finally, Ottawa may seek compensation for policing costs and consideration for compensating the businesses and people impacted...""

It’s implicit that the provincial police would also be required to assist to meet, I believe the number he was using on or about that time was 1,800 police officers, which is a very large number.

So this is a topic, Mr. Stewart, that we canvassed fairly in depth at your interview. And you’re starting here, I think, from the very initial reaction of the OPS to the protests. And you say from the beginning -- well you’re actually conveying Commissioner Lucki’s words here, or her views: “She reported that from the beginning, the OPS were on their heels. The volume of people exceeded their ability to do policing and they made a mistake in allowing trucks to come into the downtown core and park on the street. Commissioner Lucki also reported […] that the NCRCC was not working particularly well because there were personality issues involved. [Deputy Minister] Stewart explained that he got the sense that as time went on, the OPS pulled it together and the OPP got involved.” So I’ll just stop there and ask you to describe, in general terms, what you were hearing about the OPS response and what views you formed about it?",22-077-23,77,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-078-25,"My understanding, both first hand and in conversations with Chief Sloly, and second or third hand through the Commission of the RCMP, was that the situation having come to where it was, in other words, an embedded protest that, you know, had formed a perimeter, in essence, that was hard to enter and to do any enforcement within, that there was considerable debate behind the scenes as to what the strategy would be for enforcement. And kind of a chicken and egg situation, where the various police forces involved, and here I’m not just referring to the OPP and the RCMP, but also other Ontario police who ultimately came to Ottawa to assist, were waiting for a clear plan of action before they mobilized the vast amount of police officers that ultimately came to the city to take action. And that plan, you know, in the early going, was very fragmentary in the sense that it involved some enforcement actions, but it wasn’t a take down the protest plan. And the formulation of the take down the protest plan took time. And in general, I think there were differences, as far as I could tell, of a view about what the right strategy would be, and it took a couple of weeks before the right chemistry in behind the scenes in the Integrated Command Centre was attained.

So here you’re adding: “…it was difficult to get people to come to an agreement about a plan because there were personality issues in the mix.” And then you go on to talk about that. So that probably refers to what you were just saying about chemistry at the NCRCC?

And I don’t -- I would not want to lay this at the door of Chief Sloly, to be honest with you. I was hearing that he was very involved and that it was difficult, partly because everybody was stretched so thin, to get to a landing zone on a plan, and that there were disagreements about what the right strategy was. My own first-hand experience with Chief Sloly was quite limited, and to the calls that we had with the City, I had seen him before in another context, but not met him.

22-081-03,"The RCMP was always willing to come and assist and always wanted to, you know, sort of play a role, and were willing to do so. But to get RCMP officers into Ontario is actually quite a significant logistical issue, because they only have federal police in the province. They don’t have contract people. Now, RCMP is contract police in a number of provinces and territories, which is your regular police, and who are trained and equipped to do public order and enforce the law, and relatively speaking, they had very few federal police in Ontario. So to get RCMP officers into Ottawa required them to be mobilized outside the province, and that requires, you know, some paperwork and agreement and a request of the Minister of the jurisdiction and approval by the Minister of Public Safety. So they were -- they were concerned that they were being pressed to do this without a plan and they wanted the OPP to be first in line to come and help, but they were always willing to help.",22-081-05,81,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

We’ve heard again evidence about this already in the Commission. Mr. Clerk, if you can just scroll to page 13. Now, I appreciate here that it was your colleague, not you, speaking.

I can’t really put a time on that, to be honest with you. But it was a material enough issue that, of course, when we did the Orders under the Emergency Act we decided to, you know, exempt the RCMP from that requirement so that they could move a lot of people into the province very quickly.",22-082-12,82,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-083-13,"Well, two things, in essence. One, it was my experience two years before when we had the Wet’suwet’en protests and we had the situation in Tyendinaga where the trains were blocked. And my conversations with, again, Deputy Minister Di Tommaso at that time where he was very clearly and strongly expressing the view, and this was based on history through the OPP, that de-escalation is very important to managing a protest, and enforcement can only lead to further trouble. And that was certainly -- seemed very likely in the context of the Wet’suwet’en protests. But I’d say as a more general matter in the context of the conversations that I was having with him he just always held that view, that from a policing point of view -- and I want to say this -- actually, I want to say this very quickly. The police, as I understand them -- and I’ve come to know them fairly well in the three years I’ve been in the job, at least the RCMP, are very concerned about public safety and protecting public safety and keeping the peace. And they will always prefer, given the latitude to do so, to de-escalate and to find ways to stop protests and prevent violence from occurring without taking enforcement action because it’s safer for their members and it’s safer for the public. And so this is, in a sense, the first principle of policing, protect the members and the public from, you know, things escalating. And in that context, you know -- and it’s been mentioned, I think, in testimony before the activities of the Police Liaison Teams is very important.",22-083-15,83,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-084-13,"Okay. So this -- in time, we’re in February 6th here and this was a view that you say you held from your own experience and was being expressed by Mr. Di Tommaso from his policing experience. Okay. Mr. Clerk, can we now bring up February 8th minutes, which is SSM.NSC.CAN00000295. Page 10, please. There we go. Paragraph 8. So here the Deputy Minister provided an update on engagement with Ottawa, confirming that since the injunction has been in place, there have been no horns used in Ottawa by the protestors. “The OPS is reporting that their staff are tired and need enforcements. It is evident that the protest is well organized and that the blockade at Ambassador Bridge is designed to divide the attention of the Ontario Provincial Policy. The Deputy Minister confirmed that Ottawa has developed a plan that is being reviewed by the OPP and the RCMP, which includes four key elements: reliance on negotiation; ongoing enforcement; containing the demonstrations once an area’s cleared, and gathering intelligence of various trucking companies.” Okay. So a couple of things I want to ask you about here. First of all, just to situate us in time, this is now February 8th and the blockade at Ambassador Bridge has happened and sort of coalesced on February 7th. So one thing you note is that there’s -- the Ambassador Bridge blockade is designed to divide the attention of the OPP and that this is evidence that the protest is well organized. Can you comment on that and whether -- where that observation came from and...?",22-084-15,84,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY (cont’d),MS.

22-085-22,"It may have been an overstatement. It is evident that the protests were being organized in a way that attracted significant numbers of individuals, and it wasn’t, in fact, just the Ambassador Bridge. It was elsewhere in Ontario, ultimately, other ports of entry where convoys manifested. So well is perhaps too strong a word, but there were -- there was definitely organization happening. And I want to be a little bit clear here that, you know, we were not well sited when it came to how people were communicating with each other.

In -- later on in British Columbia, we had the Pacific Highway convoy. So those would be the principal ones. Every day in our calls with Ministers, CBSA would be reporting across a whole set of ports of entry what they were observing, and they had -- they had taken steps to better equip themselves to see what was going on and to talk to local police authorities to see if it could all be met, could be managed that if a trucking or a convoy manifested itself, it could be directed away from the port of entry and couldn't install itself in the port, or on the bridge, or whatever the case may be.",22-086-26,86,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-089-28,"So I've mentioned earlier that the federal government, to the best of my knowledge, had made a decision not to engage formally the leaders or the protesters in -- you know, just allowing them to represent their views. And that was, as far as I was aware, an issue of principle and rooted in a sense that it was hard to know who to engage and also what that engagement would lead to. And there was definitely no desire to get into discussions around the Federal Public Health Policy, which was one of the original reasons the protests occurred. As time passed, the notion of engagement kind of morphed into more of what I've already mentioned as being kind of a police tactic and a potentially useful one. So shortly -- the day before, in fact, this meeting occurred, we were -- we Deputy Ministers were meeting and agreed that we would pursue any ideas we could come up with from our list, which you have I think attached to this document, and see what it turned up by way of possible decisions, possible actions for the federal government. So I had reached out, in fact, on the morning of this day to Marcel Beaudin, who had been identified to me by the -- no, by Mario Di Tommaso and echoed by the Commissioner, Commissioner Lucki, that he would be the right person to talk to. And we had a general conversation around, you know, the role of PLTs and de-escalation, and which was very educational for me. And what I took from that conversation was that there was some possibility that if they could identify appropriate interlocutors, and he said that they knew of six people that they could talk to who were leaders of a sort within the protest, and offer an opportunity for them to be heard, that this would have the effect of allowing people to achieve something, and some success, and feel that their objectives had been achieved and therefore leave. And this is where the statistics come up is that, you know, 80 percent of the protesters -- at particularly 2 and 2-and-a-half weeks into the protest, you know, where they'd been sitting on the streets of Ottawa in freezing weather were probably likely to go if they had the right offer. And so we were talking about that possibility. And it was really at that point in time, not about engagement in the way that it had been about engagement before. It was more in the context of engagement as a steppingstone to enforcement, because it was very clear by the 10th of February that the RCMP, the OPP and the Ottawa Police Service were beginning to come together on a plan, and enforcement was only a matter of time. And so in the background, of course, was this question which I think was very material in the overall decision to invoke the act of what would that enforcement engender by way of reaction. And we had strong concerns, as Mr. Rochon has mentioned, about, you know, lone wolves, and people who'd been attracted to the protest that could act out in a violent way. So there was a virtue to de-escalation in this context.",22-089-30,89,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY (cont’d),DM ROBERT STEWART,dm. robert stewart

In the context of coming up with options for federal government action, at a point in time when the protests were in Ottawa in particular, but just nationwide given the slow roll convoys manifesting all over the place, what could we do that would help. And so with the aid of Inspector Beaudin, I drafted a very short document. It's attached to the minutes of one of these IRG meetings. And, you know, brought it forward for consideration. Essentially, it was the notion that the federal government would acknowledge the desire to meet and offer to do so at a later time, away from the protest, on the basis that a protester would denounce the protest and leave. So it was essentially a, you know, a bargain. And it was positioned to be just a hearing of protester's views and not any discussion of what the federal government would do or could do. There was at -- it happened very quickly. We did it over a day or so and didn't have time to do anything other than consult with sort of key authorities, which would have been the RCMP and the OPP and colleagues at PCO, who obviously were leading the overall effort.

I would just have been trying to keep him apprised of the state of affairs. And I would have said to him, I believe, that, you know, there are pros and cons of invoking the Act, because that was my view.

Whereas, the Ontario order, which was put out on the Friday, contained very significant penalties, $100,000.

First, before I begin, sir, I am going to be referring to one document that I believe I need leave before I do so.

It’s the statement from the CSIS panel. The relevance and materiality of that is that these gentlemen were the -- essentially the consumers of information and there is a lot of statements in there with respect to what the government was told and when, and I’m intending to put that to them.

22-159-22,"I'd like to clarify that point. There is a very high noise to signal ratio in social media. So there's a challenge inherently in monitoring all the channels that people use to communicate, to the extent that they're accessible. And there are many that are not, they're encrypted. So it would be, I think, a mistake to say that the police or any institution have necessarily all the capabilities they need to monitor what is going on in the electronic world. And then beyond that, it's about assessing it and trying to make sure that, you know, what we understand to be the case is either likely to be or is the case, and that assessment process is also very challenging.

And while that's coming up, I expect that most of my questions will be directed to Mr. Stewart through Mr. Rochon. If you have some insight or some information, then please chime in. All right. So this is your witness summary. Can we go to page 21, and the last paragraph? And I want to ask some questions about the consultation that took place before the invocation of the Act. It reads: “DM Stewart added that the Act was welcomed by law enforcement (especially police of jurisdiction). Though they were never explicitly asked to invoke the Act, they were asked whether they had the tools they needed and the answer was consistently that they could use more tools.” I want to ask about that paragraph in particular; you used the word “they” which suggests that multiple law enforcement agencies were canvassed about tools that could be used under the Act. Is that a fair characterization of the summary?",22-162-26,162,26,24,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. CHRISTOPHER DIANA,MR. CHRISTOPHER DIANA,christopher diana

And I think this is the document that we were talking about earlier about the need to focus on the public safety portfolio elements a bit more and not duplicate what Justice or other departments might say. And so -- yes, okay. So on this page -- I gather this is roughly what you communicated during these briefings. So first, noting that the Emergencies Act is a significant step, one that will help ensure law enforcement across Canada, at broad and clear authority to protect public safety, ensure out borders remain open, and safeguard our national security. And then scrolling down a bit, it's also noted that this is a message to people who are participating in these protests and interfering in critical infrastructure, that there will be consequences. And then at a little bit more, the next paragraph notes that these measures will supplement existing provincial and territorial measures and assist the RCMP in becoming integrated. I think this -- it probably speaks a little bit to that question of avoiding the swearing in and some of that red tape. And then it's this last next paragraph that I want to ask about. So it says: “It’s important to underscore that invoking the Emergencies Act does not give the federal government the authority to direct the Police Services in any other jurisdiction.” So two questions, I guess, but the first is -- is that statement, that the use of any other jurisdiction -- are you saying here that using the Emergencies Act allows the federal government to direct the federal police, the RCMP?

And you note there was better control in the first meeting because it was one that you were chairing. “Second (2nd) brief was bananas -- Justice is at fault.” Can you tell is a bit about that second briefing and what happened there in terms of the communications?",22-186-29,186,29,27,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

22-187-14,"Certainly. The way these briefs are typically handled, in my experience having gone through many of these over the course of my career, is that you normally have a moderator. So a moderator from a particular department will invite -- will essentially moderate a call. This typically will happen on a teleconference line. The teleconference line will be open to a series of stakeholders. If it’s a media event, for example, you'll have a number of media spokespeople who will be in a queue and they -- having never been on the other side, I’m not sure what technology they use. But they get into a queue in order to be able to ask questions. Normally, a moderator will open up, will explain who is representing the government, will walk through the time that will be allotted to an opening statement by the government officials, and how much time will be allotted for questions, and whether or not questions -- whether or not stakeholders are afforded a follow-up to that question. Having been a former Assistant Deputy Minister of Communications in a previous department, this is protocol that we normally follow. Unfortunately, in light of the way that these were being set up, this particular brief, from my recollection, Justice was supposed to be lead. So the first meeting was chaired by Public Safety. We would have followed that protocol. And therefore, we only would have gotten to six questions because the six questions were likely rather broad and they were followed by each a follow-up. And we didn’t -- the cut-off time of an hour, if I remember correctly, that first brief, ended up limiting itself to six questions. And there were a number of people in the queue that complained about that which is my first point. The second brief was one that was led by Justice officials. They didn’t have a moderator. And so if I remember correctly, I came on and had to play the role of moderator and try to police how the call was being managed because there was no moderator. Hence, my comment that it was rather bananas.",22-187-16,187,16,14,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. CARA ZWIBEL,ADM DOMINIC ROCHON,adm. dominic rochon

So Section 9 of the Police Services Act, Section 9(1) talks about, you know, when a police service is absent during adequate OPP assistance may be sought. So what 9(1) says is, ""If the Commission finds that a municipality to which 4(1) applies is not providing police services, it may request that the Commissioner have the Ontario Provincial Police give assistance."" So what it says is that it may request that the Commissioner have the Ontario Provincial Police give assistance. And now if we scroll down to subsection (6), what it says here is, ""A municipal chief of police who is of the opinion that an emergency exists in a municipality may request that the Commissioner have the Ontario Provincial Police give assistance."" So what I say is, you know, these sections enable the OPS to go to the OPP, but I don't see anything in the Act that says the OPS cannot go to the RCMP first or that the OPS can only go to the RCMP after they've gone to the OPP.

22-218-28,"Mr. Rochon, you mentioned that there were unknowns, and you talked about intelligence, I believe, in some of your answers.

ROBERT MacKINNON,robert mackinnon
22-219-04,"I would argue there are always intelligence gaps. That’s the nature of the business. Part of the -- part of collecting intelligence and fusing it and assessing it is to come up with questions as to what is in the art of the possible; therefore, what do -- what is it that we know and what could also transpire and what do we need to protect Canada and Canadians against in terms of assessing threats? So when it comes to the unknown, you will have seen through a number of assessments, reports, whether it be from the Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre, ITAC; or PCOIAS, the Intelligence Assessment Secretariat; or indeed, from RCMP or other intelligence organizations, they were always flagging the level of threat. They would articulate it as medium and they would articulate the possibility of Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremism and the fact that a lone wolf could occur. And so when it comes to assessing intelligence, there's always a level of what is the likelihood that something could transpire? So when it comes to unknowns, there were many unknowns throughout the situation, and as the situation continued to be prolonged, and indeed, as we saw it expand across the country, those questions as to whether or not a hostile state actor may be involved in terms of funding, whether there were questions of extremist groups or possible extremist factions involved, would this provide fertile ground for extremists to recruit? There were counter-protests that were emerging as well, so all of that factored into a bunch of questions that I would characterize as unknowns and that needed to be taken into consideration. So it's not just factually, what did we know, because at the end of the day, when it comes to intelligence and when it comes to law enforcement and security, it's not about dealing with something once it happens, but it's about preventing something before it happens, and in order to prevent it, you need to think through what could happen and put in place measures to protect Canada and Canadians.",22-219-06,219,6,4,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

But even on the eve of that enforcement action, after the Emergencies Act was invoked, we had no awareness as to what was in the trucks or how people who were in the trucks would react to an enforcement action.

So Mr. Carrique writes: “With respect to your comments yesterday, I agree we need to assure OPS leaves Steve in play until we have done what we need to do. Introducing a new external player in a short terms will set us back.” Commissioner Luck then replies: “I will see what I can do to get them to delay bringing in an interim Chief, if you think that will help.” Commissioner Carrique responds: “If you have some influence I think it would be helpful. Our Ministry Policing Advisor is going to suggest the same.” Going on to the next page, “10-4,” says Commissioner Lucki. And then she says, “Had DM Stewart reach into Steve K, Ottawa City Manager. He assures that they are very sensitive to this, keen f for the ICC plan to proceed and don’t want Bell to be replaced.

The other major part is a breakdown between the trading relationship between the two countries and the amount of work that we do in terms of contacts with -- mostly with the business community.

22-238-11,"That’s correct. So at the time where the convoys were starting, we actually had another crisis situation brewing, which was the imminent invasion of Ukraine by Russia. And so Deputy Minister Morgan made the decision that she would focus on Ukraine primarily and would delegate responsibility to me to handle the headquarters aspects of the convoy related issues. So my primary role at the time was to participate in the regular meetings of the DMOCC, the Deputy Ministers Operations Committee, that I think you’ve heard about earlier in these sessions. And then also, I engaged with a number of colleagues in the department, particularly our colleagues responsible for North America relations and then also colleagues in Protocol, which is a part of the department that is responsible for supporting foreign missions in Canada.",22-238-13,238,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-240-07,"So I think the initial response was like a response to maybe other protests that had happened in the past in Ottawa. I mean, Ottawa is the capital city, and so protests are not infrequent. And so I think my own early thoughts were, “I wonder what kind of road closures there will be? We might have to ask staff to redirect.” So initially it was, I think, that kind of response.

22-241-04,"Okay. Well, it doesn't matter too much day of the week, but that's the approximate moment in time. Okay. So what would you say the GAC's mandate became very engaged?",22-241-06,241,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
22-241-09,"So I think initially the mandate was around wanting to ensure that we were living up to our obligations under the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. So this is the International Legal Instrument under which we are responsible for ensuring the security of diplomatic missions in Canada. And so in the downtown core area, that was affected by the convoy initially, there were about 50 diplomatic properties. Most of them were embassies, a couple of them official residences, so those are the homes of ambassadors or high commissioners. And so the department, under that legal instrument, has a particular responsibility to ensure the safety and security of diplomatic missions and their staff, and to ensure that they're able to access their facilities unimpeded, that their consular clients are able to attend to those buildings. So that was the early area of focus for us, and this was primarily done at the working level in the early days. And then the second aspect of our mandate that really started to come into play a little bit later was with the blockades at various border crossings, and particularly, the blockade of the Ambassador Bridge became an enormous area of focus, just because it's such an important crossing, about 25 percent of our trade with the United States goes over the Ambassador Bridge. So that's when there started to be an enormous of amount of engagement, particularly with U.S. officials, but also concerns that we started to have about our reputation as an international trading country and as a country that was safe for investment, and that started to come up as we headed into sort of the 7th and 8th of February and thereafter.",22-241-11,241,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

But before we get there, I just want to set the stage contextually a little bit, some things that you brought up in your interview and that are also referred to in the institutional reports and in the documents. So you've mentioned that Ukraine was a crisis the GAC was dealing with at the time as well. And there's a couple of other contextual elements. So, Mr. Clerk, I'll ask you to bring up PB.CAN.0000027.

It doesn't matter if it's an adversary or an ally -- we can't be this reliant on parts coming from foreign countries. I've been in contact with the White House today about [the] situation, [...] they are closely following these events. We are [...] waiting for [the] Prime Minister Trudeau's way forward."" So, yes, thank you for the correction on the date. I believe it's the 9th. And then she goes on to say, ""The one thing that couldn't be more clear is that we have to bring American manufacturing back home to states like Michigan. If we don't, it's American workers like the folks at Delta Township who are left holding the bag."" So can you tell us a little bit generally about that concept of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. and what was going on generally in that at the time?",22-243-23,243,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-245-02,"So maybe I'll start, and Mr. Comartin might want to add. A couple of different things that I would point to. First, from a Canadian perspective, we were quite concerned because, of course, the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge was happening after two years of COVID, where we already seeing supply chains quite stressed. A lot of businesses were already under considerable strain. And so I think there was a lot of concern on the part of businesses that was exacerbated by that background. The second issue is that we have over many, many years had to fight very hard for access to American markets and also for the supply chains including with respect to the auto industry in Canada. There's a strong trend towards buy America in the United States and also a strong trend among some parts of the U.S. political class to bring manufacturing back to the United States. And so there's an ongoing effort by Global Affairs, by other federal departments, but also by provincial governments and our missions in the United States to continually make the case that Canada is a reliable trading partner and also reliable investment partner.

And she did, I believe, subsequently have a call with the Ambassador. The important part about her role, is that both the Ambassador Bridge and the tunnel are in her district, as is the new crossing that’s being built currently. So she has a major interest in the impact that this was having.

And she has with Canada as well. And made some statements that were fairly close to what the statements were that you saw from Elissa Slotkin. So I wanted to raise that with her and so we had a good conversation. I had asked her, in keeping with what calls I had had with Representative Kildee and with Senator Peters that we were seeking from them -- for them when they were talking about this in public, that they would stress the importance of the relationship between Canada and the United States. And she assured me in the course of this conversation that she would attempt to do that going forward. I think the other point at this particular time, so it was easier for me I think to convince her to be sympathetic, was the injunction either had been granted -- I think that call was in the morning; the injunction was granted by the Superior Court in Windsor later that day and I had seen -- I had assured her that I expected it would be a positive order and the injunction would be granted.

So that was something that I was aware of.

From an economic perspective, we are a very trade and investment-dependent economy. Over 60 percent of the value of our GDP is made up of international trade in goods and services, so we're a particularly trade-dependent country. And so we need to maintain a strong and positive reputation as a place where people can safety trade and invest and do business. And part of that sort of positive trading and investment climate is a climate where the law is respected. And so clearly what we were seeing during this period was a very significant defiance of the law at both significant border crossings and in some of our large cities, including Ottawa. I think we were also really concerned from a broader reputational perspective that our flag was being used in some of these copycat protests that were happening around the world. The flag is a symbol of our country and it was being used, frankly, as a symbol of defiance of the law, and we were quite concerned about those reputational impacts.",22-256-27,256,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And I would say probably the largest copycat protest that we saw was in Wellington, sort of quite a similar phenomenon of large numbers of protestors entrenching themselves around the Parliamentary precinct in Wellington. We also saw other protests of smaller scale in the Hague, in Paris. There were some smaller ones, I think, in Rome, in Sweden.

So while I can’t say exactly what Mr. Goodale was thinking when he wrote this, my interpretation of this is that you know, a lot of people that he was talking with were surprised that in Canada you would see protests like this where there was widespread violation of the law and that this wasn’t the kind of protest that people would associate with Canada. And I think also, one of the things that we were talking about at the time was also the significant impact of disinformation on the climate here in Canada and abroad.

Those are really some of the foundations of our economic prosperity. And one of the foundations of being able to have that kind of trade and investment environment is to have the rule of law. And I think there were real concerns as Mr. Goodale is expressing here in his email that perhaps Canada was not able to respond effectively to some of the illegal actions that we were seeing in the protests. And then I think more broadly it’s not just about that trade and investment environment. It’s also the fact that, you know, Canada wants to protect its reputation more broadly as a country where there is rule of law alongside democracy.",22-261-23,261,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Bullet number 3 references: “…as part of the justification for the Emergencies Act, the adverse effects resulting from the impacts of the blockade on Canada’s relationship with its trading partners including the U.S. that are detrimental to the interests of Canada.” So the reference there is to its relationship with its trading partners in the plural.

22-262-28,"So I think the overwhelming focus was the United States. And you know, in part that’s because 75 percent of our trade is with the United States. So it’s overwhelmingly our largest trading partner. Also, the United States is overwhelmingly our largest investor. About 50 percent of all foreign investment in Canada is from the U.S., so it’s not surprising that the U.S. would dominate that conversation. That said, just to give an example, some of the key companies that were directly affected by the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge were actually not U.S. companies. They were Korean and Japanese companies. So both Toyota and Honda experienced immediate effects in Ontario as a result of the blockade and the inability to get parts. So while we didn’t hear directly from those countries, clearly those major foreign investors from other countries were directly affected and so we were concerned about the perceptions of other trading partners too in terms of their view of Canada as a safe place to do business.",22-262-30,262,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-264-05,"Sure. So within Global Affairs we have an Office of Protocol that has a number of responsibilities. One of its responsibilities is to support both incoming and outgoing high level visits. So the Office of Protocol supports visits in and outgoing that are related to the Prime Minister or the Governor General and the Ministers of Global Affairs Canada. But it also has a specific responsibility with respect to the diplomatic corps in Canada. So there are about 8,000 diplomats accredited to Canada. They’re across the country but of course, given that Ottawa is the capital city, they are heavily concentrated in Ottawa and many of the embassies and consulates located across the country would engage with us. There’s a whole range of things that we take care of them. We take care of their accreditation. We provide advice, help with a lot of the documentation for them, and we have, as I mentioned earlier to you colleague, a very specific responsibility to the diplomatic presence here in Canada under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

22-265-01,"That’s correct. So we have a mechanism whereby embassies or any diplomatic presence or diplomat can lodge formal complaints or concerns with the Office of Protocol. And we have on record a number of embassies based in Ottawa raising concerns about the impact of the convoy protest in Ottawa on their ability to function effectively. I should also note that in addition to that formal channel with the Office of Protocol there are also informal channels of communication with our geographic branches in Global Affairs Canada. So we have branches that are responsible for Europe and the Middle East, for Africa, for North America, and for Asia Pacific. And so there are daily conversations between missions in those parts of the department, and we wouldn’t necessarily have formal records, but we do understand that there were also complaints lodged through those more informal mechanisms.",22-265-03,265,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

22-267-01,"Yes. So maybe a couple of things to clarify. The RCMP can probably speak to this better than I can. Usually the concerns of both Embassies and Consulates, and frankly our own protocol people, is around demonstrations that are focused on a particular Embassy. So you’ll see protests because of a certain country’s policies or activities and there are demonstrations like that quite regularly. And so we would count on the RCMP to provide protective policing, if those demonstrations were to the point that we were concerned about the security of that particular facility. What was, I think, quite interesting about the convoy protest is they weren’t directed at diplomatic missions at all. In fact, we were obviously concerned about the safety of diplomatic premises, but we never had any indication that Embassies or official residences of Ambassadors were the target of any of the issues. I think a lot of our concerns were more like the concerns that we heard from regular Ottawa citizens, which was their safety on the street, we were concerned about potential harassment because I think we had heard about many cases where that had happened with public servants, with Ottawa residents. And so under international law, we have a particular responsibility to ensure the safety and security of Diplomats. And so it was that broader context that we were concerned about.",22-267-03,267,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. DAHLIA SHUHAIBAR,ADM CYNTHIA TERMORSHUIZEN,adm. cynthia termorshuizen

So each day, I would provide inputs on what we were hearing from diplomatic missions, what we were hearing from trading partners, from businesses, and so on. So that was one channel. We also provided reporting in to the Privy Council Office on issues under Global Affairs Canada’s mandate, and then we also provided information, where appropriate, to the Government Operations Centre.

22-269-12,"Sure. So RRM stands for the Rapid Response Mechanism. So this was something that was agreed to at the G7 leaders meeting in 2018 in Charlevoix when Canada was the host. And the mandate of the RRM was really to identify and respond to threats from foreign state actors on G7 democracies. And we were particularly focused on threats oriented towards democratic institutions and processes, towards -- threats towards our media and our social media and online environment, and then also threats to the exercise of human rights and freedoms.

22-273-07,"Yeah, maybe just to emphasize the -- and, again, I’m speaking particularly in my territory. When the blockade hit, it hit at a really crucial time, both in terms of what was going on in the auto manufacturing sector, the types of development that’s coming; we’re going to build a whole new supply chain in order to have the electric vehicles come on line. And Canada has the potential to play a great role in that. That was jeopardized by this blockade. I think we’ve been able to put most of it to bed now, but it was a high risk period of time for that to occur, especially coming out of the pandemic when the manufacturing sector had been so hard hit.

SO is it fair to conclude that the RRM analysis -- if we see RRM say it hasn’t seen evidence of significant foreign state involvement relative to the convoy, that isn’t to suggest that there is a complete lack of connection between the disinformation environment in the broader sense and those events; is that fair?",22-294-15,294,15,13,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

22-296-09,"So, sir, for the record, Brendan Miller appearing as Counsel for Freedom Corp. Sir, there's been an issue with respect to disclosure from the Department of Justice for some time and I just wanted to point out some things. As per Relativity, I've been told how to organize it with respect to uploads and when they were uploaded. I can advise the Commission that since November 6th, the Department of Justice has dumped in about, well, 199 new records, and over the weekend alone, since we adjourned 409. Some of these documents are extraordinarily relevant, including entire team message chats with Brenda Lucki and the RCMP during the IRG meetings, commenting on what's going on. They're not even in the Commission's list of documents for tomorrow because they probably don't know about them. They're not labelled. I found them by accident. There is an issue at this juncture, in my submission, with a dump truck approach, in my submission, on behalf of the DOJ in order to provide in disclosure late that is relevant material, should have been provided quite some time ago, and it's not even properly labelled. For example, all of those -- there's Teams meetings with all the executive of the RCMP about what's happening. It's very interesting. I'm just finding it now, but nobody seems to know about it because of late disclosure and because it's not properly labelled and because it's coming in in mass quantities. So, sir, I wanted to raise that with you. I would submit that this Commission has jurisdiction to compel the DOJ to outline and properly label materials and provide them properly, outline what they are, and not simply name them random letters and numbers, so that people don't see them. I only spotted them today, a couple hours ago, because I got lucky.",22-296-10,296,10,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BRENDAN van NIEJENHUIS,MR. BRENDAN MILLER,brendan miller
22-297-12,"It's a rather non- specific complaint and I don't take it my friend is seeking relief. I can assure you, Commissioner, that in -- a large number of people are working incredible hours and have been doing so for many months to assemble documents. The Government of Canada is a large institution with many document sources and the items that are of key relevance, accordingly, take a great deal of time to identify, process and code. If there's a specific complaint about a specific item that I can be of assistance in addressing, I think we'd be more efficient to address that offline with my friend in terms of the concern or through Commission Counsel would be the appropriate route. But in the absence of a specific request or a specific complaint, I don't think there's more I can say sitting here now. I'm not prepared to speak to the issue at the moment in more particularity.",22-297-13,297,13,12,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BRENDAN van NIEJENHUIS,MR. BRENDAN van NIEJENHUIS,brendan van niejenhuis
22-297-28,"Sir, I'm simply asking if the Commission can direct the DOJ to properly label what the items are in relativity, who the parties are discussing matters in there with the proper date, as opposed to just it being dumped in with random numbers and then, you know, we're dealing with literally 1299 documents, records, not pages, records, that have been dumped in since November 6th, and we're all here, all day, and then trying to find this stuff, it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. And it's not something, for example, in a civil case, we call them affidavits of records back home. I believe in Ontario they're called statement of records. I apologise, I'm not from here, but you're required to label the date, the actual record and et cetera, and that's how Relativity's set up. But I'm finding these extraordinarily compelling documents that not even the Commission has in their list of documents for tomorrow, and we're talking about text messages and iMessage system of sorts between Commissioner Lucki and all the executive of the RCMP during the IRG meetings and other things about what's going to be done. And they're not labelled, and I found them by luck. And in my submission, that's just not appropriate. These things need to be labelled. They need to actually say what they are. They can't just be dumped into the system last minute in the hopes that one of us luckily finds them. I don't know what else is in there, in those 1299 documents. I'm trying to get through them, but it's impossible to assess by just looking at the labels, et cetera, in Relativity when they're not actually labelled at all as to what they are.",22-297-29,297,29,28,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

If the Commission Counsel has a concern about the adequacy of the coding, we'll be happy to do our best to remedy that. Obviously, these things take time, and if they take time, then that slows the process of getting things into the database, which is the whole purpose of the inquiry, so that they can be put into the public record as appropriate.",22-299-06,299,6,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

22-299-16,"Okay. Well, I think at this stage, certainly as I did at the outset, the Counsel are encouraged to raise issues with Commission Counsel as soon as they arise, and to the degree possible, they can be addressed that way. If they can't be addressed and some relief is necessary, then you bring it to me. I think your concern has been raised. I think Commission Counsel will look into it. I do want to cycle back and point out that I have acknowledged and continue to acknowledge that it is challenging for Counsel, and certainly for Counsel for the Government of Canada, but also, Counsel for all the parties. And I think to the degree that you have frustration, I understand it, and I think at one level it is totally understandable because of the way the compressed timeline that the Commission has to operate under. So if it is possible to provide some relief in the way you describe, I think it is highly desirable, but not if it's going to mean that we won't get access to documents. And I know that's been a concern of mine that to make sure the record is as complete as possible. If there is a real unfairness, that's something I will certainly entertain, because ultimately, the objective of this Commission is to be fair and as open in the context of the constraints we're operating under. So I'd encourage you to speak to Commission Counsel if there's some way to alleviate because I know the Government of Canada obviously is a very significant player in this, as are their witnesses. So I want to be sure we do what we can to ensure the best possible analysis of their documents and listening to their witnesses. So with that, I apologise for being a little preachy, but I do understand, and we'll see what we can do. So we'll adjourn until 9:30 and, again, I expect it'll be a similar day tomorrow and probably similar days this week that'll be fairly long.",22-299-17,299,17,16,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

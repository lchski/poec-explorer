29-008-11,"Good morning, Commissioner. Jeff Leon, Commission Counsel. This morning, we're going to shift gears and focus on what has been a very important part of this Commission's work, that is, the views of the Canadian public. It's our pleasure to present to you an overview summary of the results of our public submission process. As you know, shortly after your appointment, you committed to providing an opportunity for members of the public to participate in the work of the Commission. That's essential to have a full and complete picture for the Commission's deliberations. The public submission process was launched in August. At that time, you again commented on the importance of the Commission receiving, and I quote: ""...meaningful public input from a wide range of Canadians, not just those individuals and entities who have been granted standing. This is in keeping with my commitment to conduct an open and transparent public inquiry that provides an opportunity for involvement by all Canadians."" (As read) The public submission process ran until October 31st, and I am pleased to report that it was a success. The Commission received almost 9,500 submissions from a broad cross-section of Canadians. In terms of age, respondents self- identified as being from all age groups, but primarily 25 to 44 and 45 to 64, which is consistent with Canadian statistics as being representative of the Canadian population. In terms of location, we heard from respondents in nine provinces or territories across Canada, primarily British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec, which again is consistent with the fact that these provinces contain the largest concentrations of population in Canada. In terms of those who were -- responded, we heard from those involved in the protests, community members affected by the protests, and members of the public, who wanted to tell the Commission about their views in terms of the work that the Commission has undertaken. Indeed, the Commission undertook to review all these submissions, a final report is being prepared, and this presentation will be a summary of the matters to be covered in that report. You will see that we have been successful in collecting, indeed, a wide variety of views, observations, ideas, and experiences of Canadians on all aspects of the Commission's mandate, including the circumstances that led to the declaration of a Public Order Emergency, and the measures taken for dealing with the declared emergency in February of 2022. We received submissions in three ways: through an online questionnaire, email, and mail. Overall, these submissions have been of great assistance to the Commission in appreciating how the matters being considered affected and impacted Canadians. They provide background and context for the Commission to inform its deliberations in this Inquiry, which, after all, is a public inquiry. I note that this overview that we will now present is not evidence. Like some of the other background presentations that have been tabled, it will be posted on the Commission's website. On behalf of the Commission, we extend our thanks to the many Canadians who generously took time and made the effort to assist in the Commission's process. You have performed an important service as Canadians. I will now ask my colleague, Sajeda Hedaraly, to present the summary, after which I will share with you excerpts from a few of the actual submissions we received to give a first-hand flavour of the breadth and quality of these submissions.",29-008-12,8,12,11,speaker_start,PRESENTATION: OVERVIEW SUMMARY BY MR.

29-010-27,"Good morning, Mr. Commissioner. For the record, I'm Sajeda Hedaraly, Commission Counsel. As mentioned by Mr. Leon, this presentation is a summary of the comments that the Commission received from the public. It would be impossible to attempt to convey every point made in the over 9,000 submissions we received in this presentation, but we hope to convey important parts of what was shared with us. As you will see, we have organised the presentation around various themes that were collated from the comments that we received. La présentation de ce matin sera bilingue. Les personnes qui ont besoin d’un casque d’écoute devraient les garder à portée de main. So first... If we can go to the next slide, please, Mr. Clerk. D’abord, parlons du contexte de la pandémie de COVID-19 qui a été exprimé par plusieurs membres du public. Plusieurs personnes ont discuté d’un sentiment d’exclusion et d’isolement qui était dû ou bien de leur statut vaccinal ou de leurs opinions contre les mesures sanitaires. Si on pouvait aller à la prochaine diapositive, s’il vous plait. Selon ces personnes, ces commentaires que nous avons reçus, les mesures sanitaires ont été en place pendant trop longtemps et ceci a aggravé les difficultés que ces personnes éprouvaient dans les autres sphères de la société — par exemple le travail, les évènements sociaux, et cetera — et ils sentaient une certaine discrimination due à la politisation des questions entourant le statut vaccinal. We also heard from people who felt pride in the convoy. For them, the convoy brought a sense of belonging among people who shared similar views on the pandemic. These people had a sense of obligation to participate in these protests to defend the rights and freedoms of Canadians. Some of those people also acknowledged the impact on the Ottawa residents of the protests, but in their view the Nation's Capital belonged to all Canadians and they were still justified to be there. They were proud to have been part of an important grassroots movement. Ces mêmes personnes avaient généralement une vision pacifique des manifestations. Par exemple, nous avons ici une citation d’un manifestant qui nous dit qu’il a été touché par la gentillesse et le respect dont ont fait preuve ses concitoyens canadiens pendant les manifestations. Plusieurs personnes nous ont fait part du fait que les trois semaines de manifestation à Ottawa ont été absentes de violence, de vandalisme, de misogynie, de racisme et de haine. Les écarts qu’on pouvait voir de haine, comme des pancartes sur lesquelles on voyait des injures, étaient les exceptions. Au contraire, ce qui émanait des manifestations pour ces personnes était des bonnes actions de la part des manifestants, la distribution de nourriture, le nettoyage de rues, le pelletage de neige, et cetera. We also received comments from community members who were affected by the protests. Many people expressed that their mental health was impacted by the protests. Some felt trapped in their homes. Next slide, please, Mr. Clerk. The continuous honking was disturbing to them. They also had difficulty breathing and headaches due to the diesel emissions from stationary truck engines. They also talked about the impact of road closures and limited public transport. For example, various appointments had to be rescheduled for health services. They also reported lack of mental health support. Ces personnes craignaient également pour leur sécurité. Ils trouvaient qu’ils n’avaient jamais vu autant de personnes commettre des crimes et mettre les autres en danger pour des opinions politiques. Ces personnes avaient une expérience régulière d’anxiété, de stress, de colère et de peur face aux évènements. Certains nous ont également parlé du harcèlement et du comportement agressif qu’ils ont vus de la part de manifestants ou qu’ils ont vécus. Certains, par exemple, ont été ciblés et interpelés pour avoir porté des masques dans des espaces publics et — si nous allons à la prochaine diapositive, s’il vous plait — certains avaient l’impression que des manifestants s’étaient donné pour mission personnelle d’intimider les personnes masquées à Ottawa. Certains groupes avaient peur de quitter leur domicile spécifiquement parce qu’ils trouvaient qu’ils avaient un risque accru de faire l’objet d’un discours haineux et plusieurs personnes ont également estimé que la police ne les protégeaient pas parce qu’ils signalaient des incidents, mais que ceux-ci ne faisaient pas l’objet d’enquêtes et ils trouvaient que les lois et les règlements n’étaient pas appliqués. We’ve also heard a lot about disruption to daily life. We have here a quote: “I’m a 65-year-old retired high school teacher, who relies on my volunteering shifts at the museum to remain active, both physically and mentally. The prolonged COVID shutdown of the museum was difficult for me, and the ensuing protest exacerbated the personal impact.” (As read) These personal impacts included deprivation of peace, quiet, and sleep. Many people also reported being unable to work effectively or work at all. And as mentioned earlier, many residents had to make drastic changes to their schedules. There were also impacts on non-governmental organizations and charity who had to adjust their services and could not serve the community in the way that they would have hoped to. There were also impacts on local businesses and services. Residents reported difficulties obtaining various services or getting groceries, for example, and some downtown businesses also had to close, which resulted in an important loss of income which was particularly important to them because of the previous COVID-19 measures that had been imposed. Les membres du public qui s’opposaient aux manifestations nous disent qu’ils soutiennent la liberté d’expression, mais que les limites étaient dépassées ici. Lorsque la liberté d’une personne à s’exprimer empiétait sur leurs droits, ils trouvaient que ça allait trop loin; même s’ils supportaient la liberté d’expression, ils pensaient qu’il y avait des limites qui devaient être imposées. Un membre du public nous a dit : « Les manifestants parlaient de liberté, mais pas de leurs responsabilités en tant que citoyens. » Pour ces personnes, les manifestations portaient atteinte à la démocratie canadienne — nous y reviendrons un peu plus tard dans la présentation. Ces personnes qui s’opposaient aux manifestations avaient un sentiment de colère du fait que les manifestants prétendaient s’exprimer au nom de tous les Canadiens et Canadiennes alors que ce n’était pas le cas. Pour plusieurs personnes, les manifestations n’étaient plutôt qu’une opportunité pour des individus frustrés de participer à un évènement unique et de bruler un excès d’énergie au nom de la liberté, mais sans plus. Let’s now turn to media coverage of the protests. We’ve heard several comments on misrepresentation and excessive media coverage. We have a comment here: “Media lied about all of it. They wanted people not in Ottawa to think the protesters were a bunch of redneck hooligans causing mayhem.” (As read) This is fairly representative of many comments that we received, which expressed low levels of trust for mainstream media compared to new media such as YouTube or other social media. In their view, mainstream media was misrepresenting the facts surrounding the protests, and in their view that was often because these organizations receive subsidies from the States and therefore are mouthpieces for the government. Many people also expressed that excessive media coverage of the exceptions in Ottawa, who displayed signs with profanity or historical symbols -- historical hate symbols, were being represented excessively and didn’t actually represent the people who were at the protests, and these people expressed emotional distress at being associated with these hateful symbols. On nous a également parlé du discours du gouvernement fédéral par rapport aux manifestants et manifestantes et que celui-ci visait à diviser la population. Pour plusieurs personnes, les représentants et représentantes politiques au fédéral cherchaient à discréditer le mouvement du convoi, ils ne cherchaient qu’à alimenter, selon eux, la trame narrative selon laquelle les manifestants ne représentaient qu’une minorité. Ce discours a affecté négativement l’opinion du public à l’égard des manifestants et ceux-ci, tel que mentionné plus tôt, se sentaient ostracisés et avaient de la détresse émotionnelle à ce sujet. Indeed, for those people the government used a double standard when it dealt with protests. It perceived that the federal government had different standards when it came to different types of protests. They expressed that in recent years there had been numerous protests of a violent nature in Canada that led to various blockades, for example, led by different groups with different interests than theirs, and yet the Act had never been invoked to deal with these excesses; and, indeed, the Prime Minister had met with most of these groups. Those people found that the invocation of the Act not only was disproportionate but was also vindictive toward protesters with whom the government did not share values. Plusieurs nous ont dit que les manifestations auraient pu être résolues de manière pacifique si seulement des négociations avaient eu lieu. Tout ce qu’il y avait à faire, comme nous dit ce manifestant, « tout ce qu’il y avait à faire était de s’entretenir avec les camionneurs et résoudre le problème, mais au lieu de cela, on a choisi d’appeler les personnes ‘a small fringe minority with unacceptable views’ ». Ce que les manifestants voulaient, ils nous disent dans leurs soumissions publiques, c’était une forme de dialogue, une conversation, ils voulaient simplement que leurs opinions soient prises en compte, mais, pour eux, il y avait un manque de volonté de la part du gouvernement fédéral d’entendre d’autres points de vue et de résoudre la situation de manière pacifique. Certains ajoutent même qu’en signe de bonne volonté, des camions avaient été déplacés et qu’on s’attendait à ce que cette action conduise à de nouvelles négociations avec des représentants du gouvernement et ça n’a pas fonctionné, et on nous a exprimé que c’était similaire… l’utilisation de la Loi suite à ce geste de bonne volonté équivalait à un abus de pouvoir. On nous a notamment mentionné que les blocages à Coutts et à Windsor avaient été levés avant l’invocation de la Loi, ce qui, à leurs yeux, justifiait… justifie leur opinion que l’invocation de la Loi était un abus. We have heard of many different kinds of frustrations against politicians. This time, in this slide, expresses frustrations towards politicians who supported the protests, rather than those who didn’t meet with the protesters. So some people expressed that extra frustration because some politicians chose to support the protesters for what seemed to be merely political gain, and for them the invocation of the Act was the only possible outcome to clear the occupation, and all political debates and discussions between different political parties were unnecessary and non- collaborative and not in the best interest of residents, especially in Ottawa. Ce sentiment d’abandon nous a été exprimé par plusieurs personnes qui nous ont aussi parlé de leur perte de confiance envers les autorités. Ce sentiment d’abandon était également étendu à la police en raison de son inaction dans l’application des lois et plusieurs se demandaient comment trois forces policières à Ottawa n’ont pas pu contenir une manifestation qui était pourtant prévisible et ils nous ont mentionné que la Loi n’aurait peut-être pas été nécessaire si la police avait été mieux organisée et agi plus tôt. On se demandait également les raisons pour lesquelles des outils règlementaires n’avaient pas été utilisés, tels que des contraventions. Une personne nous a également dit que l’inaction de la police a incité des résidents et résidentes à se rassembler pour empêcher l’accès à plus de camions au centre- ville et le counter-protest dont nous avons entendu parler préalablement. This leads to the next point. Some people told us the Act might not have been necessary if law enforcement had acted earlier. People spoke of failures by multiple levels of government. For the City of Ottawa, they said that the City should have limited truck access to designated zones throughout the city, which would have avoided the blockade, what they call a blockade. They also say that the Ottawa Police remained inactive, despite various complaints that they received of harassment and intimidation by residents of Ottawa. We were also told that -- we also received criticisms concerning the Province of Ontario, that only took action once the economic impacts of the border blockade in Windsor became apparent. And these people told us that Ontario could have dealt with the crisis, but instead passed on responsibility to the Federal Government. And of course, we also received criticism from the Federal Government -- about the Federal Government’s actions, pardon. Je vais maintenant me tourner plus spécifi… plus généralement à des commentaires sur l’invocation de la Loi. Je vous parlerai d’abord de ceux qui trouvaient l’invocation de la Loi nécessaire avant de discuter de ceux qui la trouvaient injustifiée. Pour ceux qui la trouvaient nécessaire, l’invocation de la Loi a apporté un soulagement. Les résultats qui ont suivi l’invocation de la Loi, pour ces personnes, ont montré sa nécessité, le fait que c’est ce qui a permis de dégager les foules et d'ouvrir les routes. La Loi a permis aux résidents d’Ottawa de retrouver un semblant de vie normale et un sentiment de sécurité et, pour plusieurs personnes, de regagner leur domicile parce qu’ils l’avaient quitté. Pour ces personnes, l’invocation de la Loi est une réponse tout à fait appropriée, mesurée et ciblée pour mettre fins aux manifestations. Ces personnes nous ont également parlé du fait que les éléments extrémistes et violents du convoi présentaient un danger pour les Canadiens et pour la démocratie. Pour eux, toutes les autres options avaient été épuisées, il s’agissait effectivement d’un dernier recours. Le gouvernement fédéral avait la responsabilité d’agir afin de protéger la population, et ce, par tous les moyens possibles. We’ve also heard from others that the invocation of the Act was unjustified and inappropriate. For those people, the protests in Ottawa were peaceful and did not meet the requirements needed to invoke the Act. There was no serious or immediate danger to the lives, health, or safety of Canadians. The Act was invoked while all other options had not been exhausted, and that led to violent confrontations between police and protestors. These people also told us that existing laws should have been enforced by local and provincial authorities, the Criminal Code, notably, other laws, and bylaws, could have been sufficient to manage any illegal behaviour. For them, the decision to use the Act was a political one by frustrated federal officials who had no sympathy for the protestors. On nous a parlé de craintes au moment de la déclaration de la situation de crise. Une personne par exemple nous a dit, une fois que la Loi a été adoptée, il se posait des questions : « Mon compte bancaire serait-il gelé parce que j’avais partagé des vidéos du convoi sur mes réseaux sociaux? Je suis allé à la banque et j’ai vidé mon compte. » « Serai-je arrêté pour avoir été présent au convoi à Ottawa? J’ai décidé de ne pas attendre et de voir ce qui était pour se passer. J’ai fui le pays. » Et plus tard, il me dit : « Lorsque la Loi a été invoquée, on m’a montré qu’aucune loi, constitution ou charte n’est au-dessus d’eux — du gouvernement — et que la Loi ne m’offre aucune protection. » Ces craintes étaient multiples : il y a eu des craintes de violence physique par la police, une peur à la vue de gaz lacrymogènes, peur à la vue de la force utilisée pour déplacer et remorquer des camions, la peur de faire l’objet d’une enquête et d’être arrêté pour des activités antérieures à l’invocation de la Loi, la crainte de répercussions pour avoir appuyer en ligne les manifestants, une crainte que ses comptes bancaires soient gelés et d’ainsi perdre ses moyens de subsistance, et certains ont quitté ou ont considéré quitter le pays. Ça nous amène aux impacts directs de la Loi sur la vie des manifestants et des gens qui les ont appuyés. Some people reported that they suffered physical injury from the use of cayenne pepper, batons, and anti-riot gear. Many found themselves in a precarious situation because of their inability to access their bank accounts for various periods of time, and many questioned their trust in banking institutions. Cette perte de confiance est également étendue envers le gouvernement et les institutions, notamment la police et les banques. Pour certaines personnes, l’invocation de la Loi a créé un précédent risqué, elle était perçue comme une attaque contre tout groupe qui a des opinions opposées à celles du gouvernement. Certaines personnes nous ont également dit qu’elles ne feraient plus de dons à des organismes de bienfaisance parce qu’elles auraient peur de ce qui arriverait à leur compte bancaire si ces organismes s’opposaient au gouvernement au pouvoir dans l’avenir. Pour ces personnes, leurs droits liés à la liberté d’expression et à la manifestation ont été détruits. This lost of trust for some also led to persistent fear of the government and of institutions. Some people expressed that they were now anxious to participate in general political discourse because of the repercussions it might have in their lives. They were scared of being monitored for their political view, and they also are now scared in the presence of police and are scared of being arrested for their political views. D’autres personnes nous ont également invoqué un sentiment de peur pour des raisons différentes. Nous avons ici quelqu’un qui nous dit : « Au fur et à mesure que les manifestations se poursuivaient, j’ai commencé à réaliser qu’elles étaient plus antigouvernementales qu’antivaccins. C’est à ce moment-là que j’ai commencé à avoir peur. Ces gens réclamaient le renversement du gouvernement et, au fil des semaines, personne ne les arrêtait. J’ai commencé à avoir peur pour notre pays. » En effet, ces personnes avaient une anxiété par rapport à la chute des systèmes démocratiques au Canada. Pour eux, le cynisme… ils avaient du cynisme relativement à l’affichage continu de rhétoriques anti-gouvernementales, ils soulignaient qu’il s’agissait là d’un nouveau phénomène qui était plutôt inquiétant. Ils exhortent… ces personnes exhortent les institutions à prendre au sérieux les menaces envers le système démocratique au pays; ce type de mouvement peut ressurgir à tout moment et ces personnes voyaient les manifestations de janvier-février dernier comme un signal d’alerte pour ce qui pourrait se reproduire à l’avenir. We have also heard about the damage and changing perception to Canadian symbols. We have heard of people who are now anxious when they see Canadian flags, while they used to be proud of being Canadians. A community member told us, “I want my flag back, quite simply.” For these people, the image of the Canadian flag has changed, its symbolism has been tainted, and they were heartbroken by the use of Canadian symbols by the protestors. They now associate these symbols with the protests, with hate speech, and with intolerance. And they were -- these people do not understand the casual behaviour of the authorities. The use of the flag for political purposes, and also the symbolic gesture of flying it upside altered people’s attachments to the Canadian flag and their sense of pride, and they now have a sense of distrust when they see cars flying a Canadian flag. On nous a également exprimé une inquiétude par rapport à la réputation du Canada à l’international, et ce, de tous bords tous côtés. Certaines personnes ont exprimé un sentiment de honte à l’égard de la gestion de la manifestation par les autorités et, pour ces personnes, c’est l’inaction du gouvernement face aux manifestations et l’attention médiatique qui a été accordée qui a atteint la réputation du Canada. Pour d’autres, c’est l’invocation de la Loi sur les mesures d’urgence qui était injustifiée et qui a nui à la réputation du Canada en tant que société démocratique qui ne laissait pas les gens exprimer leurs opinions. Donc, d’abord, la perte de fierté dans l’identité canadienne — un peu comme on a discuté tantôt avec le drapeau — en raison de l’association du convoi avec des éléments extrémistes; pour ces personnes, avait également un impact sur la réputation du Canada à l’international. Et des gens nous ont également exprimé une inquiétude par rapport à la relation entre le Canada et les États-Unis, notamment des blocages aux postes frontaliers. Cet impact, pour ces personnes, a un impact tant symbolique, économique, que diplomatique sur les relations du Canada avec le reste du monde. Et d’autres personnes, tel que mentionné plus tôt, se sentent au contraire moins en sécurité relativement à leur capacité à faire des affaires au Canada, par exemple en raison du gel de leurs comptes bancaires. We have also heard some concerns over foreign influence. There was a perception that the online donations allowed foreign donors to interfere in a domestic issue, and people -- many people believed that the convoy was inspired by the events of January 6th, 2021, in the United States Capitol. There was a widespread belief that far right ideologies and anti-government rhetoric is growing and spreading, and that that was reinforced by actors in the United States during the protests. Passons maintenant aux recommandations du public. D’abord, les recommandations du public relativement à la Loi sur les mesures d’urgence spécifiquement et ensuite nous irons à des recommandations plus générales par le public. Par rapport à la Loi, plusieurs personnes nous ont dit qu’il ne devrait pas être possible d’invoquer la Loi par simple majorité au Parlement. Le seuil pour invoquer la Loi devrait être plus restrictif, et on nous a donné plusieurs suggestions sur les façons avec lesquelles ça pourrait être plus restrictif. On nous a également dit que le pouvoir d’invoquer la Loi devrait faire preuve d’une plus grande surveillance de la part d’autres institutions gouvernementales. Et enfin, on nous a dit que les termes et le langage dans la Loi devraient être mieux définis. On nous a dit que la Loi avait eu pour effet de permettre aux forces de l’ordre de travailler ensemble à Ottawa et de supprimer des frontières juridictionnelles, et donc, on nous a dit qu’à l’avenir la Loi devrait être revue pour que les différents niveaux d’intervention soient ajustés en fonction de la gravité de la situation. Spécifiquement par rapport à la région de la Capitale nationale, on nous a dit que la Loi devrait tenir compte des compétences… des problèmes de compétences uniques auxquels est confrontée la région d’Ottawa et que plus de clarté était nécessaire concernant le rôle des différents corps policiers dans le maintien de l’ordre à Ottawa. I'm sorry, can you go back to the previous slide. Thank you. Plusieurs personnes nous ont dit que le seuil pour invoquer la Loi doit rester élevé pour s’assurer que son utilisation n’est pas disproportionnée par rapport à la gravité de la situation. Finally, let's turn to general recommendations from the public. Many people told us that future protests should always require a permit and that the use of motorised vehicles in a protest should be prohibited. We also heard that a by-law or a law to mitigate engine idling should be adopted. In times of crisis, various legal entities and government bodies must coordinate with one another to resolve jurisdictional disputes. And we were told that that should be clarified. We also were told that there should be more consequences, more legal consequences for people who deliberately spread lies, misinformation and hate, and that social media platforms that host mis-information and dis-information should also be targeted by such laws. We were told that the use of the Confederate flag and other hate symbols in Canada should be banned, and that the government must do better to educate and prevent the radicalisation of Canadians. Laws that curtail foreign funding of anti-democratic group and movements within Canada should be enacted. There should be a firmer application of standard behaviour in police forces and in military forces, and screening practices for hiring these personnel is necessary. And finally, we were told that there should be better support for the press and journalists, given their essential function in countering mis-information and dis-information. I will now pass the baton back to Mr. Leon, who will conclude with a few quotations from the comments that we have received. Encore une fois, merci à tous ceux et celles qui ont participé au processus de soumissions publiques. Your input is very much appreciated by the Commission.",29-010-29,10,29,27,speaker_start,PRESENTATION: OVERVIEW SUMMARY BY MS. SAJEDA HEDARALY,MS. SAJEDA HEDARALY,sajeda hedaraly

29-027-25,"Commissioner, Jeff Leon, Commission Counsel. Having heard this summary, which is of necessity, given the large number of submissions, is at a high level, it will be helpful to understand in the respondents' own words their views and how the events under consideration impacted them. You will hear a variety of views from across Canada, which is reflective of the diverse reaction of Canadians to the issues before this Commission. First: ""I live in Victoria, B.C., in the neighbourhood behind the provincial legislature, James Bay to be exact. At the height of the Freedom Convoy, I worked part-time for a small, family- run retail establishment located in Victoria. We were forced to close the shop early three Saturdays in a row due to the constant honking, some of it amplified over loudspeakers. The constant honking was anxiety-inducing. Customers who did come in did not stay. I do not know how much revenue was lost, but winter is our busiest season, Saturday the busiest day. The owners were kind and gracious enough to pay us. I felt bad taking the money. This is only part of how the convoy affected me. I walk to work, so the entire way home constant horns blasting could be heard blocks away. It is a half-hour walk. Once I reached my neighbourhood, protesters were also on foot. They were loud, in some cases inebriated and menacing, they exhibited behaviour as a group I am sure they would not attempt individually. This behaviour continued daily for months. Elderly were scared to leave their homes. I was most distressed that it took as long as it did to invoke the Emergency Act."" Second: ""The convoy protest in Winnipeg impacted our mental health significantly. We live near the legislature where the convoy honked, blocked streets, emergency vehicles forced to take longer routes, waved offensive signs, harassed locals for wearing masks at a bus, or in local food or coffee shops, parked on streets, blocking locals. The loud honking for hours, long vehicle parade with flags was an assault. Our mental health was severely impacted, and any complaints to police were seen as a few complainers repeating and therefore of no real consequence. Our police did nothing. Plus the abuse of the Canada flag caused us not to put up our flag on July 1st. We felt helpless. We had to get away to a hotel for several days to keep our sanity. We felt on the edge of sanity. Until the Emergency Act finally came in, and suddenly things happened. With that, our police would not have ended this as quick. We kept hoping the Federal Government would enact that step because this protest should never, ever, ever have gotten away with this outright lawlessness and disregard for fellow citizens. This lack of action has forever changed our country for the worse, shaken our confidence in protection. The Emergency Act was absolutely necessary. We also believe it was ended quickly, showing there was no intent to abuse its power. It was the reason we finally got some relief, even here in Winnipeg. As a lasting impact, we are attempting to find a way to move out of this area, because even now, any significant honking on Broadway hits with a fear the protestors are back. Hours of honking past our apartment block change dour life because no one stopped it until the Emergency Act came in and Ottawa was being cleaned up, and then, and only then, did our police act. We were shattered.” (As read) Third. “I am a hospital pharmacist in Windsor, Ontario. Our border was blocked by protestors connected to the Ottawa protest. I did not personally need to cross the border during that time, but I did experience shortages of some food and commodities that are transported through the border. I am also angry that my city had to use tax payer’s money to deal with these circumstances. I resent the fact that money could have been used constructively to improve the city, was instead used to manage and contain the protestors. As a health care worker, I literally risked my life to go into the hospital where I work and care for sick people who required our services. If a protestor was one of the people needing my skills, I would provide it with the same diligence and empathy as with any other patient. In contrast, the protestors seem not to respect the needs of community members, at best inconvenienced, and at worst, terrorized by their occupation. Everyone has a right to protest, but they do not have the right to prevent others from carrying out daily activities, having access to food, or supplies, or simply feeling safe in their neighbourhoods.” (As read) Number four. “I am writing to express my sincerest opinions and experiences regarding the Freedom Convoy protest and the implementation of the Emergencies Act. This letter will provide what I hope to be a useful recount of a working-class Canadian citizen who believes in freedom and the Charter of guaranteed right to democratic protest. In the months of January and February of 2022, I made the long drive to Ottawa from Scarborough to peacefully protest in the Freedom Convoy. As a COVID-19 unvaccinated Canadian, I had already been facing discrimination, oppression, and hate for two years as a direct result of the Federal Government’s politicization of the vaccine. I am a young, active, healthy woman who had no medical need or personal desire to take an experimental vaccine. I was ridiculed by my peers and strangers alike, banned from leaving and re-entering my own country, public transit, sports leagues, restaurants, and shopping centres, to name a few. My decision to maintain medical and bodily autonomy nearly cost me my job. These vaccine mandates were systematically being imposed sector by sector, leaving hard working Canadians to be either coerced into sacrificing bodily autonomy or stripped of their livelihoods. Many of my COVID-19 unvaccinated family and friends were horrified and panicked at the very real possibility of having to flee our own country, a country which has stood for freedom and equality for over 150 years, until the truckers stopped them. The Freedom Convoy was a beacon of hope for millions of Canadians, millions of Canadians who faced threats, job suspension, and getting cancelled online as a result of expressing dissent. Through propaganda and polarization of the media, myself and many others were made to believe that there was nobody else out there who held the same perspective. We were made to believe that we had no ground to stand on and that if we spoke up, there would be no one there to back us up. And then came the news of the trucker convoy bound for our Nation’s capital, and inviting anyone and everyone to join. Here was finally a place where we could take a stand and show our government that we did not agree. The Freedom Convoy protests represent a new marker in Canadian history. They brought Canadians together. They brought the world together, inspiring protests in countries all over the world. The repercussions of the convoy spread far beyond what we could have ever imagined. Citizens of other countries waved Canadian flags, snag the Canadian National Anthem, and messaged and commented on social media in support of the Canadians. We became the pinnacle of a peaceful protest. I would like the Commission to take a moment to process what that must have felt like, to have spent hours, even days, waving a Canadian flag, singing O’Canada shoulder to shoulder with strangers, inviting our government to engage in a discussion about our democratic rights, and instead being labeled and criticized so harshly. Please imagine enduring the extreme cold temperatures holding a sign above your head just so you can finally have your voice heard and your life back. Imagine seeing people laughing together and dancing and standing guard on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Imagining just wanting your freedom back. Not more, nothing demanding. Just what you already had before. Then you come home, watch the news, and see yourself labeled as a domestic terrorist, as someone who does not represent the views of Canadians.” (As read) Five. “I supported the trucker convoy for many reasons and in many ways. I have truckers in my family and they were coerced into taking the vaccines and one family member was out of a job. The mandates and vaccine policies in this country have affected my children, myself, and my family in so many ways. They have created a huge divide amongst us: those who opted to take the vaccine and those who abstained. My family will never get back to where we were before covid. So when the trucks rolled out on their way to Ottawa, I supported them however I could. I donated to the GoFundMe page and then doubled my portion to GiveSendGo when GoFundMe shut down. I have yet to see my money back from GiveSendGo. I sent my kids out to the bridge overpass to wave on the trucks as they rolled down the highway towards Ottawa. The second weekend of the protest, I took the seven-hour car ride to Ottawa to see for myself what was happening downtown. I have never in my life seen such selfless people giving their time and energy to support such a noble cause. It was crowded and noisy due to the trucks running in the streets, and honking, and the immense amount of people there made noise. But it was music to my ears. It was a reuniting of Canadian people. It was the Canada I knew from 25 years ago when I travelled abroad. People from all provinces had gathered to become family. All nationalities were represented. It was wonderful. It was the best Canada Day celebrations I have ever participated in. It gave me such pride for Canada again. Such joy to be a part of the waving Canadian flags, the happy people singing, dancing, and yes, there were bouncy castles for the little people. There was food in the streets to feed armies. It was unbelievable. The joy I felt watching the videos of the trucks rolling down the highway for this reunification of our people who had been so isolated and trapped for two years, and then seeing it set up in Ottawa to be able to partake in was phenomenal. There was no violence and the police were literally standing around everywhere trying to keep warm, but in reality, had nothing to do in the areas that I walked around downtown. There was nothing to fear and people were kind and loving all weekend. Two weeks later, I took the trip to Ottawa again. unfortunately, this trip was much less enjoyable, because the police had already blocked the downtown entrances, and we heard of the violence that had already occurred with regard to the trucks, the vandalism, the tear gas. I made it to Coventry and heard from the trucks that got out just in time. They described the violence they had already experienced and witnessed. One trucker described as having been teargassed, his eyes were still itchy. I ran into a reporter who had been physically harmed by officers during covering the story. It got ugly due to the officers. It wasn't the supporting protesters causing this. I met many of the helpers at Coventry who had been there since day one and the stories we were able to share with one another about the purpose of this protest were beautiful."" (As read) Number six, ""Thank you for the opportunity to give feedback on this polarizing issue in our country. I believe that evoking the Emergencies Act was the correct thing to do, and if anything, I would like to have seen a more forceful dispersion of protesters and others who engaged in these reckless and irresponsible actions. I was not a protester myself, nor was I in the capital city at the time of this event. However, I can attest to the broad reach of this group's influence and the effects it had on other provinces besides Ontario. These individuals threatened the entire country with their negligence by attacking our already frail food chain supply through the use of blockades. Living in Newfoundland, a large concern has always been if we will have enough food shipped onto the island to make sure everyone can get by. Although this group was unsuccessful with completely stunting the food supply chain, it did -- still did a number on our ability to get needed goods. Walking into the grocery store for some time was a stressful experience, as you would just have to hope that enough of what you needed made it to our isolated province. This in turn created a greater pressure on truckers who were continuing to do their job to the best of their ability while having to make unnecessarily long routes to avoid the blockades."" (As read) Seven, ""I lived in the red zone during the convoy occupation of Ottawa, six blocks from Parliament. The abuse and harassment from the convoy was constant and unacceptable. The 18 hours of honking day in, day out was torment. Implements such as the air horns used for commercial trains were employed, which were designed for announcing presence in a wide space at high speeds. When used in a dense, urban setting, they resonate off all the buildings and penetrate walls. The idling of trucks was also dangerous and destructive. The air quality at street level with the 24/7 generation of diesel fumes being trapped by cold air made breathing difficult for me as someone with asthma. I live in an apartment on the third floor of my building. And even if the trucks hadn't been honking incessantly, I would still have needed to keep all my windows shut and not use my balcony because I could taste the diesel fumes in the air on my balcony. Having people shout at me when I went for groceries was frustrating as well. For all the generalizations people like to make about what it's like to live downtown, the reality is, I've never felt unsafe or harassed on the street. And aside from the occasional event promoter on street corners, I've never been accosted on the streets. The convoy people made it very clear that I, by virtue of wearing a mask in public, was their enemy. On multiple nights, convoy people shot off commercial grade fireworks from the street in the middle of the night. These were the kind of fireworks that have spread -- have a spread of greater than 25 meters being fired from 2-lane, 1-way streets directly adjacent to apartment buildings with open balconies. The sleep disruption of having fireworks go off at midnight literally outside my building was infuriating, but the fire hazard this presented was completely unacceptable. Police were called multiple times every time and their response was always that they're keeping an eye on it. Their standing policy appeared to be being ready to call the fire department just in case, with no intent to intervene otherwise. As an addendum to all this, seeing people openly flying swastikas outside my home did not make me feel remotely safe. I am Jewish, and to see a symbol which unambiguously advocates for the systematic murder of myself and my family being displayed with impunity sends the message genocide is not something the public deems a concern. The general media response to this further seemed to convey a tone of what are you going to do, it's a couple of swastikas, that happens, but neglected to consider the presence of the swastika in isolation is very different from when it's owned by a group of hundreds, if not thousands of people, with large vehicles who have surrounded your living space while actively intimidating you. While I'm no stranger to discrimination, I have never at any other point in my life felt surrounded by people who wished me dead. It's abhorrent that I am expected to view this kind of behaviour in my community as just how life is when it very much is not."" (As read) Eight, I am a 73-year-old Ottawa resident of Sandy Hill, just across the canal from the area occupied by the protesters. I am writing not because I am important, but because I am not. What happened to us happened to tens of thousands in Ottawa from January 28 until the Emergencies Act was enforced. Centretown residents had it much worse. Within three days of the occupiers setting up, we were stymied. My regular trip on the O-Train was disrupted by anti-maskers who aggressively jeered at the masked around them, getting right into their faces. I had to transfer at the Rideau Centre to a street-level bus, and twice had white, middle-aged men snatch at my mask while demanding freedom from mandates. Returning, I witnessed a large crowd of people near the bus stop, harassing passers by, making an extraordinary amount of noise, blocking traffic, pissing on the street, and generally being obnoxious. I can't say they impressed me, but like many, I thought they'd go home after the weekend. Instead, their continued presence shut down our food stores, pharmacy, bank, medical clinic for all but telephone consultations. The disruption of O-Train and bus service meant we could not access anything in Centretown or North Leeds. We could not get cabs because drivers would not risk crossing Centretown, as several had apparently been attacked by occupiers who objected to the colour of their skin and/or to their face mask or both. Gig drivers were also refusing to come to the area. We were prisoners in the few blocks in which we lived, due to the threat of illness or violence from people who refused to leave and were able to intimidate the local authorities into acquiescing. Only by shopping at a supermarket a little farther out and early in the day, as the occupiers appeared to be late risers, we were able to get food. The pharmacist at our officially closed pharmacy actually had to sneak in to fill urgent prescriptions for regular customers and arrange back-door pickup by phone. Like many during the siege, he risked himself and his business to help others. We had to cancel medical appointments and tests, one of which was to ascertain if a lump on my husband's head was a tumour, and if so, whether it was cancerous. Answer received weeks later, yes, it was a tumour, no, it was not cancerous. I had to suspend ongoing treatment for a non-fatal intestinal issue and start over when the Emergency Act took hold. Sleep was hard to come by as pickups and SUVs drove around our area blasting horns and a couple of airhorns. Sleep is pretty basic to human health and function. (As read) Nine, In living in the Gladstone Bay area, Centretown, there was no disruption to my life whatsoever by the protest. I could not hear the trucks or their horns at this location, and my freedom of movement on foot or by car was not affected at all. My access to the 417 was entirely unaffected by the protest. I passed through the protest a number of times, usually went out for a run, sometimes went out for a walk, and a couple of times to see the protest itself. I did not experience any harassment on any of these occasions. In terms of signage, I did not personally see anything resembling a swastika or a Confederate flag. I did not wear a mask, but when observing people wearing masks within the protest, I did not see them being harassed. Framing the issue as one where people, such as myself, who live in the City core, were held hostage by the protest, is, in my case, incorrect and unwanted. The protest in no way affected me negatively. How many people were actually affected, and to what extent, remains an open question for me. Trucks were parked north/south, from Wellington to Slater, and east/west from Lyon to Elgin. Most of the buildings in this area are office buildings, the workers of which were still working from home due to prior government actions. There are some street level businesses, most of which had been required to shut down for extended periods over the previous two years. Those that wanted to stay open during the protest were able to do so. For those who were living there, I have no doubt that the protest was incredibly annoying. The problem for me is that the concerns of a group of protesters, who possibly outnumbered the residents in the affected, were ignored, dismissed, and vilified, while the inconvenience of a small number of people was made to appear as if all of us living in Ottawa were being held hostage in our homes. I found and find the lack of balance disturbing."" And then finally: ""I would like to express my experience with the illegal occupation of Ottawa that was brought to end by the invocation of the Emergencies Act. I am a secondary teacher, I work in Ottawa, and I live in Quebec. My route to work was made longer and more complicated by the illegal occupation. After nearly two years of trying to support my students through the demands of COVID crisis, I really did not need the added strain that was created by the so-called 'convoy'. More importantly, my students did not need even more stress. I teach students who were affected by the noise of the constant honking, and the odour from the vehicles that idled in Ottawa's core. As well, it was certainly disheartening to see the behaviour of adults as they danced in the streets, while so many young people, that had sacrificed so much so that we could follow protocols as safely as possible, students who missed music, dance, theatre, sports and graduation ceremonies, still followed the protocols, while some adults acted as if our public health crisis was a hoax. Finally, it was deeply troubling to see the racist, violent, and threatening message coming from these occupiers. I was most incensed when one organiser threatened to roll schools. He did not organise a roll past my school, but my understanding is that the elementary school down the street was targeted. On my route to work and back, not only was I delayed, I also felt intimidated by the vehicles with flags of various kinds driving aggressively to and from their camp. The most drastic impact that the illegal occupation had on my life was that I was unable to visit my mother on the last weekend she was alive. My mother was grieving for the loss of her son, and after my brother's death in 2019, her quality of life changed radically. While my sister, an essential worker, and her husband were primary caregivers, I tried to visit my mother every weekend. You are probably aware that those of us who live in the Ottawa/Gatineau Region experience our communities as more unified than separated. For me to take two trips to Orleans on a weekend was not at all unusual until the convoy. On both the Saturday and the Sunday of the last weekend in January, I tried to get across the bridge from Wakefield to Orleans to see my mom. I was not successful either day. The police had closed the route. While I had just seen her on the Tuesday prior to that, I felt she was slipping away and I was concerned. So these people have taken something from me that I can never get back. My mom was a dedicated educator; she was my role model. The illegal occupation of Ottawa stole my mom from me -- stole from me the last moments of my mother's life. I am grateful that the Federal Government stepped in to end it when local and provincial authorities could not.""

GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
29-054-18,"Thank you. It's -- they are two complicated roles, and it is an important question. As Minister of Justice, I'm a member of Cabinet. I'm responsible for what one might call justice policy and the development of justice policy, the curation of the Criminal Code, various institutions, Human Rights Commission, for example, and Privacy Commission, other Commissions that are associated with justice policy writ large in Canada, so they fall under my purview. I do not -- I'll frame that, I'll come back to that when I talk about the Attorney General role. So in that role, I'm a member of Cabinet, I participate in Cabinet discussions, give my opinions, as would any other Cabinet Minister, and do the work reading my documents but also other documents from other Ministers in that regard and in giving informed opinions. The other role is Attorney General. I'm the government lawyer, also sit at the Cabinet table as Attorney General, and I give legal advice to the government. I receive legal advice from time to time through the Department of Justice, which has lawyers dedicated to giving legal advice in that Attorney General role. I'm the titular head on litigation, all litigation that the Government of Canada does. And I have a role in shaping that litigation, particularly as it approaches higher courts, courts of appeal and the Supreme Court. And again, in that role, I will give advice to the Cabinet and to the Prime Minister directly from time to time. On most pieces of legislation, for example, there will be opinions being given, although there are occasional mentions in the Justice Act of the Minister of Justice giving that role, so I will -- the lines are reasonably well demarcated. They certainly are well demarcated in my mind. We've had the Anne McLellan Report of a few years back, which helped in the framing of certain kinds of litigation to distinguish the roles. And certainly, I would say that in all of my interactions with colleagues, including informal interactions, I will always try to be clear which hat I am wearing as I'm speaking, and if that hat changes in the course of a conversation, I will give them a flag. And so I'm well aware of that two -- of those two roles. What I will also say -- this is the part that I had bracketed out before, is unlike the Attorney General of the United States, I do not lead investigations and prosecutions. We have an independent prosecution service, and there are other rules that guide my relationship with the Director of Public Prosecutions, but that's important to remember as well.",29-054-20,54,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And then two paragraphs down there, the paragraph that begins ""In their role..."" ""In their role of Chief Law Officer of the Crown, the Attorney General is not accountable to a particular government. They are required to act according to the law and the broader public interest, not according to personal or partisan interests.""

29-072-09,"Thank you. And that's a fair qualification. But with that in mind, again, the Attorney General speaking to the Minister of Public Safety, who is the liaison to the Mayor of Ottawa, and this is what you say at the bottom of this text. If you can just scroll down a bit more. Thank you. ""Spoke to Doug Downey"", and here, again, you are speaking these words to Minister Mendicino, ""Need Sloly to be quick, quick, quick."" Now, I guess the question I would pose is this: Do you think that the question of whether Chief Sloly should be dealing with the Ottawa protesters ""quick, quick, quick"" or wait until he believes he has the resources to perform the operation safely, do you think the decision between those two options is an Operational decision for Chief Sloly or a decision that should be influenced by you and Minister Mendicino?",29-072-11,72,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Minister Mendicino and I have a close relationship, there's some banter here, there's some humour here. That's a reference to my favourite Christmas movie, the ""quick, quick, quick"" part, and so I think we could take the temperature down here. We, as the Government, according to the Ipperwash Report, can identify our priorities to police services, that's the role that a Minister of Public Safety has, in this case, possibly also the Minister of Emergency Preparedness, but we can't make Operational decisions, we know that. And remember, I'm not the one interacting with the police, and I'm assuming that Minister Mendicino is working with Cabinet colleagues on a level of principle.",29-072-29,72,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

29-074-21,"Understood. And on that point, you've -- we've heard from a couple of your colleagues and a number of senior officials, including police officials at all levels of government, police at the RCMP, OPP and municipal levels, about this question of the topics discussed in the Ipperwash Report in Justice Linden's report and in the Morden Report with respect to the G20 protests in Toronto, and your colleagues, who have spoken before you, have expressed an opinion on this very point you make here in your text: ""We can't make operational decisions, but sol Gen can make government priorities clear in these situations, as per Ipperwash Report."" Now, I think the Commissioner has set the precedent here that I have to give spoiler alerts in fairness to you, but this question was put by me by Minister Blair about whether it would be appropriate in the case of competing problems in different parts of the province, say, if it would be appropriate for Government or the Solicitor General in Ontario to advise the Commissioner of the OPP, if we take that jurisdiction, though, presumably, it could also apply in other contexts, to advise the Commissioner that among the two public order situations facing the province, the government of the day or the Solicitor General, in particular, considers City X to be the priority situation. The example might be as between Ottawa and Windsor. Windsor is causing huge impacts on the national economy, and so the Province considers that the priority objective for a public order getting public order back under control. Leaving it to the police to decide if they want to do anything about that input, and if so, how they would do about it. They might decide that they can't address that priority question, but the question is, is it fair that that priority be, perhaps even appropriate and necessary that that priority be expressed to the police. And Minister Blair seemed to think not. That that would be going too far even to express a priority. I think we're seeing from your text here that you're going to differ, but again, spoiler alert, Minister Mendicino also had a view on it, though I think his view covered the spectrum from all the way at no to all the way at yes, depending on which part of his answer you focussed on, so you don't have to worry about disagreeing with him. So what would you say about that scenario, where there are competing priorities, and put it at the federal level if that's something that you can identify with more appropriately, where the Federal Government is facing public order issues, perhaps not public order, perhaps environmental issues, that have caused the need for policing resources, but in one way or another a view is expressed or could be expressed by the Government about its priorities, do you think that would be appropriate to communicate that to the police of jurisdiction?",29-074-23,74,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
29-076-17,"In all cases. I mean, I think I'm probably, in most contexts, probably closer to Minister Blair in the answer that I'm going to give, although there will be some contexts where I might move towards a more flexible answer. In all cases, the Operational decisions will be made by the police of jurisdiction. In all cases. What I was referring to in the Ipperwash Report, and what the Ipperwash Report was referring to is legitimate for Government to say ""We have an important public security situation here, we need to have something done about it."" And then it ends there; right? And then it's up to the police of jurisdiction to take care of it. The scenario that you have given me is forcing me to choose or to articulate my priority as, in this case, a member of the Federal Government, to say ""We need something done in X place or Y place"", and I think the inference in your question is that there is a -- there may be a different priority elsewhere.",29-076-19,76,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

29-077-11,"It's always going to be, first of all, the Solicitor General of Ontario in the jurisdiction that we're talking about right now who is going to articulate that priority. And then, again, the operational decisions were going to be made by the police. So we're an input into that decision-making process in the province. So I'm probably closer to Minister Blair on that, although there will be, I believe, situations that -- where we may have to say as a federal government, ""Look, something is quite urgently happening here. We urge you to do something."" But in all cases, it depends on the police of jurisdiction to make operational decisions.",29-077-13,77,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-077-23,"Again, to be fair, there were parts of Mr. Blair's answer where one could draw the inference that the police of jurisdiction and the police who might be able to help from out of jurisdiction would have welcomed some input on this point. For example, you might imagine the OPP saying, ""We've got lots of Public Order Units. We can deploy them where the government considers it most appropriate. Operationally, they're roughly equivalent to us. What is your priority? Help us decide.""

I'd rather, to be honest, as a prudent Attorney General, I would rather avoid giving public legal opinions on hypothetical situations. But the nuance is there in the report.

But the decision-making power is always in the hands of Cabinet, in the Governor-in-Council in the Emergencies Act, as well as other framing provisions that need to happen for the invocation of a national emergency. So there is a definition that is incorporated by reference. It’s moved into the Emergencies Act and the decision-making power remains with Cabinet. So there’s also a purpose change. What CSIS is doing is determining whether a threshold is met for the purposes of further investigations, generally clandestine, according to CSIS protocols, with warrants, et cetera, they’re all -- you’ve heard testimony already from the CSIS Director, as well as Madam Tessier, about the rules of thumb that CSIS uses for proceeding in their analysis under section 2. That isn’t incorporated in here because the decision maker is different. And the inputs can be much wider - - have to much wider when you’re a member of Cabinet, when you’re making a decision Governor-in-Council. There are other inputs that can go into the meeting of that definitional standard that CSIS wouldn’t normally use. And so that’s very, very important to underline, that it is -- while it is the same standard of the same magnitude, the interpretation of that standard is being done according to a wider set of criteria by a very different set of people with a different goal in mind, and that goal is given by the Emergencies Act and not the CSIS Act.",29-087-27,87,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

29-119-25,"This Inquiry is, among other things, considering the extent to which state emergency powers or exceptional policing powers should be used when there is a Public Order event. For Indigenous peoples, it's often been the case that they must assemble and organise into a social movement to seek attention to the denial of their rights or even advance the recognition of their rights. Sometimes the response of police and the Government of Canada has been to target or punish Indigenous peoples for organising or speaking up for their rights or upholding their traditional laws, and treating these events as emergency events. Should the approach to Public Order events, specifically when it's Indigenous peoples involved in defending their rights, take into account their distinct and unique contexts as Indigenous peoples, including the long history of government denial of their rights, and as you mentioned earlier in your testimony today, the reality of racism and anti- Indigenous discrimination in policing and our justice system?",29-119-27,119,27,25,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

The Emergencies Act itself didn't have a consultation requirement with Indigenous peoples, that's just a result of the day -- the years in which it was drafted, I think, and the difference sensibilities at the time. That's something I would commit to change if -- as we move forward from, we'll get the report from Commissioner Rouleau, and we will see what recommendations are in there. But I do think that we need to have a more formally incorporated consultation requirement in the Emergencies Act with respect to Indigenous peoples. We did that informally, the Minister of Crown and Indigenous Relations did reach out in this case to the heads of the three national Indigenous organisations, but it could be better done down the road, and it needs to be more sensitively tailored to different nations, regions, and Indigenous organisations as we move forward.",29-120-17,120,17,15,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And the issue I would like to talk to you about today is the definition of threats to the security of Canada in the Emergencies Act. Okay? So we know that section 16 of the Emergencies Act refers to the definition in the CSIS Act, and says: ""...threats to the security of Canada has the meaning assigned by section 2 of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act."" Now, we heard from Mr. Vigneault earlier this week, and he's the Director of CSIS, and he told us that CSIS has a very clear understanding of what threats to security of Canada means in the CSIS Act based on legal interpretation, jurisprudence and Federal Court rulings. And we also heard from him that as far as CSIS was concerned in terms of what was going on during the convoy, the definition of threats to the security of Canada in the CSIS Act had not been met.

I'm not going to link facts to arguments in a way that can be -- that can impute the kind of legal advice I may or may not have given or may or may not have been given to me in this process. And I have to maintain that privileged argument. But I think you have heard from a series of witnesses this week, including Mr. Vigneault, including the exchange I had earlier with counsel, that the incorporation by reference of section 2 of the CSIS Act into section 16, given the different purposes of the CSIS Act, given the different goals that CSIS has with respect to why it is using a section 2 definition for one of its investigations in order to get to further inquiries, is different from the context in which it has been incorporated into the Emergencies Act, and the decision- making body is different. It is not CSIS, it is the Governor in Council. So there is wider, as you've heard from a number of different witnesses this week, there is a wider set of inputs that are more than just CSIS inputs. You've also heard from CSIS about the specific rules of thumb that they use in order to interpret section 2, which aren't necessarily imported into section 16 because it's a different decisionmaker.",29-123-20,123,20,18,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

This is the type of situation which gave rise to the use of the War Measures Act in 1970. This clause takes its definition of threat from the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service[s] Act. This fact alone should make us very cautious because of the difficulties already encountered with CSIS in determining what is subversion and what is legitimate dissent. That was one view of the legislation.” He goes on to say: “I would remind Members of this House that the definition of ‘threats to the security of Canada’ received exhaustive scrutiny by Parliament in 1983 during deliberations on the CSIS Act. The language in this definition has, therefore, already received Parliament’s blessing.” So I pause here to note that what Minister Beatty is saying is, you know, we are specifically incorporating the definition that’s found in the CSIS Act, because this is a definition that Parliament has already blessed.

And further down in this email is the transcript from your interview with Evan Solomon, and he's asking you about the possibility of donors being targeted by these measures.

29-155-17,"Mr. Clerk, if you could please go to page 10, paragraph 59. In considering whether a permanent injunction was appropriate to enforce municipal by-laws, the Chief Justice used strong words about the importance of the rule of law. And he says in paragraph 59: “The rule of law requires that everyone obey the law. Significant, organized, deliberate and persistent defiance of the law and court orders is a serious threat to the rule of law, which is one of the foundations of a functioning democracy.” Minister, in your view did the protests and border blockades in particular, threaten the rule of law?",29-155-19,155,19,17,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

29-156-21,"Mr. Lametti, the next paragraph we see that the Democracy Fund, which is a party here before this Commission, attended at that hearing as an intervenor friend of the court and argued that an injunction was not warranted as there were other enforcement remedies to address the unlawful conduct, including the Emergencies Act. Because as we know the Emergencies Act was already invoked at that time. And I just wanted to point out for you, I’m not sure if you knew the decision in detail, but that argument was rejected on the basis that the test for a statutory injunction under the Municipal Act does not require consideration of the availability of other enforcement remedies.",29-156-23,156,23,21,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

29-157-09,"Right. So in paragraph 68, I have one more question, Minister Lametti, although perhaps your answer may take more time than I have. At paragraph 68 the Chief Justice concluded by repeating a statement from his Reasons on the initial injunction, and he says: “Simply put, freedom of expression does not extend to the point that the protestor’s activities can result in the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms to all those detrimentally effected by the blockade.” Could you just – I know we don’t have much time, but can you unpack this balancing of rights for us, just briefly.

29-157-25,"Thank you. I agree with every word that Chief Justice Morawetz has written here. Rights are not absolute and one’s own individual rights go as far as they do not detrimentally effect the rights of others, it’s always a balance. With respect to peaceful protests, there’s always going to be a bit of inconvenience for a short period of time, but when you lock in and you block people from living and working and sleeping at night because you’re honking your horns or can’t get your children to school or to the hospital because you’ve impeded traffic, or you’ve blocked a bridge in Windsor that is vital for the economy of not just south western Ontario, but the whole country, and the impact that that has on families and on mental health and stress that it puts on people, all of that is so far beyond the legitimate exercise of free speech and freedom of expression, particularly when there’s always an option to do it legally in a time and place and space that doesn’t have that deleterious impact on other people.",29-157-27,157,27,25,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

29-162-01,"I’m Mitch McAdam, one of the lawyers for the Government of Saskatchewan. And I want to ask you a few questions about something that you said during your interview with Commission counsel. So I would ask the clerk to please pull up the interview summary. It’s WTS00000077. And if we could go to the top of page 5, please. Sir, in the second paragraph from the top of that page, you referred to the non-use of provincial legislation by provincial governments as being a factor that informed Cabinet’s decision to invoke the Emergencies Act. My question is, were you referring to Ontario’s delays in declaring a provincial emergency under their Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act?",29-162-03,162,3,1,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
29-162-15,"In part. I was also referring to inconsistency. For example, applying insurance measures across the country. That’s one o the reasons why we invoked the Emergencies Act in order to get to that particular solution.",29-162-17,162,17,15,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-162-20,"Okay. Sir, were you also referring to the fact that laws like Ottawa City by-laws or Ontario’s Highway Traffic laws were not being enforced in downtown Ottawa?",29-162-22,162,22,20,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
29-162-24,"Well, certainly a number of people felt in the public space that ticketing wasn’t happening, for example, when it could have been happening. Rigs could have been ticketed as an example. So yes, that’s possible.",29-162-26,162,26,24,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-163-01,Okay. So that possibly was a factor that was being taken into account?,29-163-03,163,3,1,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
29-163-03,"Well, it was certainly something that I took into account.",29-163-05,163,5,3,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-163-05,"Okay. Thank you, sir. And we’ve heard a lot of evidence at this Commission about various reasons why laws aren’t enforced, such as the safety of police officers and the public, the lack of resources, the lack of plans. So you're aware that there could be very good reasons why provincial laws are not being enforced?",29-163-07,163,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
29-163-11,Certainly possible.,29-163-13,163,13,11,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-163-12,"Okay. And we’ve also heard this morning in your testimony about what’s been called the separation of church and state and the fact that governments, whether they’re municipal, provincial, or federal don’t interfere with the operational decisions of police. Do you recall that?",29-163-14,163,14,12,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
29-163-18,Very well.,29-163-20,163,20,18,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-163-19,"Okay. I believe we’re having a fire alarm in our building but I'm just going to plow ahead and continue. I’m not sure if you can hear the beeping in the background. I’m curious, Minister, how does the federal government assess whether the non-use of provincial legislation warrants invoking the Emergencies Act. You're reviewing the operational decisions of police, aren’t you?",29-163-21,163,21,19,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
29-163-27,"Not at all. What we’re doing is we’re assessing facts on the ground in order to determine whether there is a national emergency and whether, according to the Emergencies Act provincial laws are adequate to the task. That includes whether there are gaps in provincial laws or whether there is a necessary -- or whether there is a non-application of laws. I mean, I could give you examples but it’s your time. So it’s really just an assessment of the adequacy of the current state of laws both in terms of their use or their non-use as a way of determining whether we’ve met the threshold for the Emergencies Act.",29-163-29,163,29,27,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-164-12,"Okay. But you will agree with me, sir, that it’s a very different thing to be identifying gaps in existing laws so that new tools can be provided, as opposed to reviewing how existing tools are being employed. Those are quite different things, aren’t they?",29-164-14,164,14,12,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
29-164-17,"Oh yes, they are. And I'm not being judgmental about the non-use. I’m just saying that’s a factor. It’s a fact on the ground. I’m not being judgmental about the non-use at all.",29-164-19,164,19,17,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-164-21,"Okay. And you'll also agree with me, sir, that to the extent it is a provincial decision as opposed to an operational decision by police, so with respect does something like a province’s decision to invoke its own Emergencies legislation -- that’s ordinarily a matter that falls within exclusive provincial jurisdiction, correct?",29-164-23,164,23,21,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
29-164-27,"Yes, that’s true. But we had a situation, for example -- I saw with my own eyes the licence plates of the rigs that were sitting on Wellington Street in Ottawa. And they came from across the country. And in order for a number of the financial measures that we put into place to work, we needed national application. And although a number of those measures fell within provincial jurisdiction, I think it was quite a reasonable observation on our part to have come to the conclusion that not every province would have put these measures into place in order for us to implement these kinds of financial measures. So again, it’s not a -- it’s a question of efficacy and using -- creating a useful tool that will fill a gap. It’s not a judgement on the operational plans of any province.",29-164-29,164,29,27,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-165-14,"Okay. And sir, you also talked about looking at the existence of effective laws and looking for gaps in the laws. And I take it that could be gaps in wither federal laws of provincial laws, correct?",29-165-16,165,16,14,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
29-165-18,That’s correct.,29-165-20,165,20,18,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-165-19,Yeah. And you would agree with me again that in the ordinary course the decision about whether to enact laws to fill gaps in provincial laws is a matter that falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces; isn’t it?,29-165-21,165,21,19,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
29-165-24,"Oh absolutely. But we’re talking about an emergency here, a temporary limited measure with very specific purposes.",29-165-26,165,26,24,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-165-27,"Okay. So just so that I'm clear then, it’s your position and the federal government’s position that when there is a national emergency, the federal government can review what provincial laws exist and how those laws are being applied and if it thinks it’s necessary, can step in and deal with those matters by orders and regulations under the Emergencies Act even though those matters would ordinarily fall under provincial jurisdiction, correct?",29-165-29,165,29,27,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam

29-166-11,"And my short answer is No, I don’t agree that -- with the way you’ve characterized it.",29-166-13,166,13,11,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-166-13,Okay. And can you tell me what part of what I've said you disagree with?,29-166-15,166,15,13,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MR. MITCH McADAM,mitch mcadam
29-166-15,I would suggest you read the Emergencies Act which says to examine the laws that exist and fill in gaps in that matter. And ---,29-166-17,166,17,15,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MITCH McADAM,MINISTER DAVID LAMETTI,minister david lametti
29-166-18,"But you would agree with me that under section 19 of the Emergencies Act, the federal government can make orders and regulations that deal with matters that in ordinary times would come under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces, correct?",29-166-20,166,20,18,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

We recognize, though, that solicitor-client privilege poses a special challenge for the Commission, not only because of issues of the extent to which you’re able to adjudicate on those issues, but also because the time it takes to resolve them, especially if the matter ends up getting referred to a Court of Superior jurisdiction would be frankly fatal to the timetable that you’re obliged to work by. And so, Commission counsel are not going to call on you to make a ruling on this issue. We would observe that we have, throughout -- that is, from the beginning of this proceeding though until now -- attempted to find a way to lift the veil that has made such a black box of what has turned out to be a central issue before the hearing. Now, if we believed that that prevented you from assessing the basis on which the government came to its conclusion, we would ask you for a ruling on it, but we are confident that there are other ways that we can get the same information on the record or get the same result through legal arguments, and so we’re not pressing you for an issue, we just regret that it ends up being an absence of transparency on the part of the government in this proceeding.",29-177-24,177,24,22,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

But fortunately, it won’t be one of the longest exams we’ve had before the Commission.

29-187-12,"Thank you very much. Now, even though we won’t be having a lot of questions for you, they are very, very important questions that have come up before the Commission and been raised by the parties in two areas that I’m going to concentrate Commission Counsel’s questions on. And I’ll just begin by headlining those two areas. One is, the role that the Department of National Defence plays when a province makes a request for assistance to the Federal Government for assistance that is potentially or perhaps best provided by the Canadian Forces. And the second area is, your views as the Minister of National Defence, of the times, if ever, and the circumstances in which it would or would not be appropriate for personnel and equipment of the Canadian Armed Forces to be used in an otherwise civil public order incident. So with that said, I will just ask you to describe a little bit about your position. I’ll begin by asking you to confirm that you were appointed as the Minister of National Defence in October of 2021; is that correct?",29-187-14,187,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

I also work closely with my Deputy Minister who under section 7 is appointed and the Deputy Minister has jurisdiction over running the Department of National Defence, Human Resources in that Department, as well as advising the Minister on decisions. And that is the –- I would say the “Triumvirate” within which we work and the framework for the decision-making in the Department of National Defence, with of course me as Minister at the Apex.",29-188-14,188,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And so in terms of the Department of National Defence, as I said, sometimes the Canadian Armed Forces and the resources of the Forces are the subject matter of requests for assistance. So for example, in hurricanes and floods, during Covid, for example the Canadian Armed Forces have been the subject of request for assistance from the provinces and we do our very best to respond in whatever way we can.",29-189-07,189,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

That is one particular way in which I, as Minister, can authorize the use of the Armed Forces and the other way is the aid to civil power. I will say, it’s very, very important to clarify that under 273 of the National Defence Act the Canadian Armed Forces are the force of last resort. What that means is, that the matter cannot be effectively dealt with other than the assistance of the Canadian Armed Forces. That is almost verbatim from the Act. And I take that very seriously. It was the main framework in which I operated as Minister, not only during the months of February and March of 2022, but since the inception of my role as Minister.

GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
29-191-05,"Most definitely. First of all we have to remember that this is a regular process, that receiving requests for assistance at the Federal Government occurs quite often and where the request concerns the Canadian Armed Forces, Minister Blair will typically have a conversation with me. I will also task my officials with questions relating to whether we can fulfill the request for assistance, understanding at all times that my goal is to ensure that we can be as helpful as possible to the entity or the person or the Governmental body requesting assistance for the purposes of serving the Canadian public.",29-191-07,191,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

29-191-16,"Now, we've heard some evidence about and your -- both your institutional report and your interview summary give some description of the two requests for assistance, the two RFAs for a logistical support from the Canadian Armed Forces that did come through in the early days of the convoy protest blockades, as the name might be appropriate in each context. One was for the Cartier Drill Hall and the other was for some rations, if that’s the right term, for the use on Parliament Hill. And can you just give, again, a thumbnail sketch of each of those RFAs?",29-191-18,191,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
29-191-27,"In each of those circumstances, my officials asked me whether I agreed with providing assistance of the forms you mentioned, the parking lot, firstly, the food rations, secondly, and I, of course, asked questions as to our ability, our resources to provide that assistance. And once I was satisfied that the resources were there for us, for example, a parking lot that was not otherwise being used and of the other example being food rations, over 1,000 packages of rations being available to the Parliamentary Protective Service, those were items that we had on hand and we could easily provide them. I want to make two further points, the first being that that triumvirate that I outlined at the beginning relating to the decision-making structure in the Department of National Defence is extremely important. Decisions that I make are based on information and advice that I receive from my officials and in particular, the Chief of Defence staff and my deputy minister. So in each of the cases that you are highlighting, I received and considered their advice before making the final decision on the RFA that came to me. Furthermore, I will say that the RFA process is one that works very well. It is robust in the sense that it is a vehicle for the federal government to offer assistance. And as I said, most recently, during Hurricane Fiona, it was the vehicle through which we at the Canadian Armed Forces were able to deliver assistance to the provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.",29-191-29,191,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Now, the next topic, I'm, as Commission counsel, just going to ask you to speak on at a relatively high level -- and to the extent parties want to provide the Commission with more information through you, they will pursue it -- but it appears from the evidence we've heard from Emergency Preparedness in particular and to some extent, Public Safety that what gets called in this proceeding the Alberta RFA, the request by the Province of Alberta for assistance from the CAF, didn’t follow the same process to what you call the triumvirate or ultimately to your desk as the first two that you described it.

29-193-12,"It did follow the same process. As I mentioned, Minister Blair will initially ask me about CAF resources, as he did in the case of the Alberta request for assistance. When I received an inquiry from Minister Blair relating to the use of CAF resources in Alberta, and in particular, the tow trucks, I then asked my officials, and particularly the chief of defence staff, to provide me with information relating to the number of trucks, the utility or usability of those trucks, and the consequences of providing that assistance. And he did provide me with his advice, and it was that advice upon which I made a preliminary decision about whether we could accede to what I heard from Minister Blair was a request.",29-193-14,193,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER ANITA ANAND,minister anita anand
29-193-26,"Fair enough. I hadn’t meant to say “followed a different process”; I guess I meant “came to a different conclusion. So can you tell us what -- and I will caution you. You might remember that there’s a limit on the details with which you can describe the difficulty of this machinery being applicable to the context in which it was hoped to be used that your documents ended up getting redacted on some fine points there. So speak at a high level. What was it in general terms that you were told about -- by your Armed Forces personnel about the suitability of the tow trucks that were otherwise based in the same general area, about their suitability for the task that they were being asked for?",29-193-28,193,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
29-194-12,"First of all, I’ll expand on the answer to that specific question about suitability because the response that I received from my team was broader. It didn’t only relate to suitability. So first and foremost, the number of trucks that the Canadian Armed Forces had available to assist were very few in number. Second of all, is the suitability point, that being that these vehicles were not suitable for the task at hand. These vehicles are typically used for very very large scale purposes. For example, pulling a tank out of the ditch, is the type of mission that we would typically use those vehicles for. And thirdly, because they are so large and so heavy, thee would be likely considerable damage to any roads on which they travelled. And then finally, using these vehicles, even if we got past the first three points that I just mentioned, would likely cause some escalation because the Canadian Armed Forces would be therefore involved in a personnel capacity and we have not discussed this yet, but I did have concerns about deploying the Canadian Armed Forces as did my chief of defence staff, as did my deputy minister for escalatory reasons.",29-194-14,194,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER ANITA ANAND,minister anita anand
29-195-12,"That’s a perfect segue to the second category that is of interest to the Commission and to the parties which is the propriety of the Canadian Armed Forces being deployed for the purposes of dealing with civil unrest or law and order issues. And you've just touched on one that intersects the two points and if I understood your answer correctly -- and I’ll just put it in my own terms -- the mere appearance of Canadian Armed Forces tow trucks at what is otherwise a public order disturbance, you and your chief of defence staff would worry could be a provocation because the equipment would be immediately recognizable as Army equipment. Is that hypothetical?",29-195-14,195,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
29-195-25,"I’d like to take a step back to give some more context to why I made the point about potential escalation which I sense is your -- the gist of your question. Any Minister of National Defence in a democracy would be loath to deploy the Canadian Armed Forces except in the most dire of circumstances. Our country’s soldiers are not police officers. They are not trained in crowd control. They are not trained in protest management. They are not law enforcement. And that reality was one that the chief of defence staff and my deputy minister and I carried with us throughout this time. Furthermore, the National Defence Act itself specifically states that the Canadian Armed Forces are the force of last resort. And I've already taken you through the legal analysis there. But if you put those two points together, we need -- and we need to make sure that the Canadian Armed Forces are not deployed in cases where we are addressing protest management or anything related to that, given the potential for escalation.",29-195-27,195,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

29-196-17,"Let me see if I can break that out into at least two parts. One point, which you were quite eloquent on, and frankly, certainly wasn’t evident to Commission Counsel until we interviewed you back in September on this point, is that there is -- it’s probably very evident to all of the parties who are representing police forces, but the training of a soldier, I will say no longer, because I think it might once have, but no longer includes the type of training that public order units in law enforcement would get in terms of crowd management and the dynamics of that situation, so they simply don’t know what to do when they encounter the crowd. At least, they haven’t been trained to deal with crowds as part of their basic training. Is that the functional point?",29-196-19,196,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
29-197-03,"I like to look at it in terms of what they are trained to do. They are trained to protect our country. they are trained to ensure the sovereignty and the security of our country. They are trained for combat.

GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER ANITA ANAND,minister anita anand
29-197-10,"Well put. And so let me -- I think implicit in what you’re saying, especially with the eloquence with which you put it, is in addition to being not well trained to engage in a law enforcement context, especially a public order disturbance context, there could be an element of escalation and provocation merely by the appearance of uniformed soldiers appearing in what is otherwise a situation of civil unrest? Is that part of your concern?",29-197-12,197,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron

29-197-21,"And a potential heightened threat to protestors, Canadians. And so my view across the board was while we need to ensure that the Canadian Armed Forces are understood to be the force of last resort, we must also, at the Department of National Defence, do what we can to support the Government of Canada in its response to the protests. And so providing the parking lot, the food rations, offering to transport RCMP officers, those were the types of supports that we were able to offer. In other words, it wasn’t simply the case that we said we are the force of last resort and therefore we can do nothing. It was more how can we be helpful within the confines of the legal parameters that define our role in the National Defence Act?",29-197-23,197,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

In other words, of course it is important to undertake some contingency planning in case there is the moment where you are called upon. And the Canadian Armed Forces are excellent planner. And there was work going on in the background at a conceptual level in case that need for options arose. But it was not formulated, it was not brought to me, given that we were still in the mode of we are the force of last resort.

Evidence was given earlier that the operational plan was anticipating that the civilians would be removed from the blockade with the equipment to be cleared at a secondary time. And I had understood from what you said, and perhaps I had a misunderstanding, that one of the concerns would be interactions between the Canadian Armed Forces and civilians and a concern that that might not be appropriate or something that they were trained to do. My question is whether your assessment of that might change with the information that an operation to clear equipment would be varied out at a time after individuals had been arrested or otherwise dispersed from the scene?",29-223-30,223,30,28,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

Okay. Just got up a little bit. Okay. So -- oh, just -- sorry, I want to see the subject. Down a little bit more please. Okay. Minister, this is an email from the Chief of Defence Staff, Wayne Eyre to yourself, dated January 28th. And the subject is: “Pre-emptive RFA Authorization - Cartier Square Drill Hall and other NCR Infrastructure”. If we scroll down, Minister, for you to just get reacquainted with this email, this is an email by which the Chief of Defence Staff provided his advice for approving assistance -- for your approval to provide infrastructure assistance to police forces in the form of the Cartier Drill Hall parking lot and other similar infrastructure.

If we scroll back a little bit more, we can see the date and your email address. So the next day, the following day, on the Saturday, the Chief of Defence Staff is providing you with an update. And then if scroll back down just a little bit more, the second paragraph, so you can see he states: “As per your email below, you approved an anticipated request from Public Safety to have law enforcement organizations use some of our CAF infrastructure…” Skipping a little bit: “You may have heard through your office that MPS has received the request, as we received this morning [a] request officials level and I have directed the CAF to provide the use of our parking lot and infrastructure to support law enforcement organizations.” And then that last sentence is what I want to bring your attention -- bring to your attention: “At no time with CAF members be employed in a security of enforcement role, nor will they conduct any assistance to law enforcement tasks.” Now, do you agree with that statement from CDS that this should be avoided?",29-226-06,226,6,4,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

29-228-06,"And that is that the sentence: ""At no time will CAF members be employed in a security of enforcement role, nor will they conduct any assistance to law enforcement tasks."" The Chief of Defence Staff knew that that was an issue that was very important to me. I had done extensive analysis and discussion relating to section 273.6(1) and (2) of the National Defence Act, and in particular, (b) of 273.6(2), which states that the matter cannot effectively be dealt with other than with the assistance of the Canadian Armed Forces. And in this email, he is, I believe, responding and addressing my concern that we are aligned on the point that the Canadian Armed Forces are the force of last resort because in a democracy the Minister of Defence, and certainly this was the case for me, would be loathe to deploy the Canadian Armed Forces in a law enforcement capacity except in the most dire circumstances. And I believe that he knew that that was my view and my interpretation of the law. It reflected our discussions, and the advice he gave me in that sentence I believe is based on those conversations that we have had and the concerns I have. And I'm sure he knew that I would -- if it wasn't in there I would have replied and indicated that it should be. Now on to the question relating to RFAs, and the substance of the RFAs. So your question is a good one. The question highlights how we have to consider each RFA on its merits, and in particular, each RFA should be evaluated on the subject matter of the RFA. The Cartier Drill Hall was a parking lot, very easily handed over for use during this time. Not being used by the Canadian Armed Forces at the time, and certainly, we wanted to support law enforcement efforts wherever possible. Et aussi, c’est la même chose avec la nourriture. We said can we help? How can we help? We have more than a thousand meal packs, and we can provide those to the Parliamentary Protective Service. And so, c’était facile avec les deux choses-là, la « calculation » et notre réponse, c’était très important d’avoir toute l’information, mais ce n’était pas le même sujet avec le troisième RFA en Alberta.",29-228-08,228,8,6,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

Il y a une différence, bien sûr, avec les soldats à l’un côté, à l’autre côté, c’est beaucoup de soldats, mais aussi l’équipement militaire pour aider les gens dans les provinces atlantiques. So in one case, we're talking about tow trucks, which were few in number, not suitable for the task and not clear that they would reach the objective desired, as well as having potential escalation by the deployment of CAF, and on the other hand, we have a natural disaster in the form of a hurricane sweeping the Atlantic provinces, and the question was can the Canadian Armed Forces help with the clearing of debris. And so as you would have seen in the news, Canadian Armed Forces were deployed in Newfoundland, PEI and Nova Scotia to make sure that the provinces had the support they needed in the clearing of debris, the restoring of power lines, the repairing of roadways and those types of undertakings. So, c’était très différent entre les deux choses et, ça, c’est le cas avec toutes les choses avec les forces armées canadiennes. À l’un côté, il y a de RFA, y’a un sujet très différent de l’autre côté, donc on doit « anhiliser » chaque RFA avec une voix différente.

So clearing large trees off of roadways, lifting them off of power lines so that power can be restored. Ça, c’est très différent, n’est-ce pas, entre les deux choses parce qu’en Alberta, c’était un cas de camions et… and our trucks were simply not suitable for the task at hand, nor were they large in number.

29-236-06,"Good afternoon, Minister Alghabra. I’m going to start with a bit of housekeeping, as we usually do with the witnesses. I’m going to ask you to remember that a couple of months ago we had an interview where we got some information from you that ended up getting put into a summary form and then sent to you and your staff for review. And what I’d like you to do is confirm that you reviewed, that you considered it to be generally accurate, and that you adopt it as part of your testimony before the Commission today.",29-236-07,236,7,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And you know, Minister, we’ve already heard from your deputy who -- with whom I canvassed pretty much the same issues that we’re going to talk about today, but our perspective -- our point of interest today is your perspective as the minister. And so let me just begin. As I recollect our interview, you were appointed the Minister of Transport in January 2012; is that correct?",29-236-17,236,17,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

29-237-06,"I’m a mechanical engineer by education, with an MBA, Master of Business Administration. I worked for many years in the private sector in the energy field. I used to volunteer for politics, knocking on doors for candidates, and one day, a vacancy came in my riding and I decided to run for office, and I got elected for the first time in 2006. And then, in 2008, the voters sent me back to the private sector, and then I was lucky enough to re- elected in 2015. And between 2015 and 2021, I served as Parliamentary Secretary on different roles. And in January 2021, the Prime Minister asked me to be the Minister of Transport.",29-237-08,237,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

29-237-23,"Because of my role, I’ve been involved heavily in government’s policies when it came to vaccine mandates and keeping Canadians safe. So I was involved with my colleagues in developing those policies and I was involved in the development of the decision to include a vaccine mandate for the transportation sector. We had an election on that and we got re-elected as a government, and I was tasked by the Prime Minister to complete -- it was part of mandate letter, to ensure the protection of the safety of those who work in the industry and those who use the industry. And there were eventually some opposition and -- where it manifested in this form of convoy protests that I heard about. I was briefed about it by the department first and then through law enforcement agencies.",29-237-25,237,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

29-238-09,"And what issues first -- what issues did the convoy present? I mean, obviously, it's a convoy of trucks and you're the Minister of Transport, but can you tell me about the connection between the federal responsibility for transport and the provincial responsibility for transport, and how you decided your department could become involved helpfully in managing the protest and the convoy?",29-238-11,238,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
29-238-16,"You know, it wasn’t -- the protests at the beginning was against all mandates, and at that time, there were vaccine mandates at all levels of government. In fact, there were vaccine mandates by -- in the private sector as well, there were vaccine mandates in universities. So I felt that there wasn’t clear who they're asking. I mean, there was a sense that they're asking the federal government, but the reality is that whatever they protesting crossed or transcended all governments and private sector. So we though were still concerned about safety, about the outcome of -- because we heard different reports on what the objective of these protests. People linked it to potentially what happened in the U.S. in Washington, DC on January 6th. So there was a lot of anxiety, and we certainly wanted to make sure that the federal government was prepared for this protest. So we were briefed by law enforcement agencies that -- and again, Ottawa is not unaccustomed to protests. It is, after all, the capital of our nation where there are typical protests. So we were briefed that law enforcement agencies were prepared. The hope that this was going to be like most protests, it might last the weekend, it might last a few days after the weekend, but the hope and the expectation that it wasn’t going to go on for a very long time.",29-238-18,238,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

29-239-15,"Right. And needless to say, it didn’t last just the weekend. When did it become apparent that your department was going to be more heavily involved than just observing the events unfold and that you would be asked by the government to take a role in finding solutions?",29-239-17,239,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
29-239-20,"I would say a few days into the protest where it had become clear that this was not a usual protest. There was a sense that there is some stalemate by law enforcement and other type of agencies. So what I decided to do, what our government decided to do is to task our officials to figure out what tools that we have in the federal authority to deal with the occupation, because by that time, it had become an occupation. So we tasked officials to do this. They did a lot of work, looking -- we couldn't -- they couldn't find any legislation or a regulation because the jurisdiction was local law enforcement. It either was the responsibility of the local police or the provincial authorities. So then what we did and what I tasked the -- our department is to put together a toolkit, to be proactive, out of a sense of being proactive and collaborative and constructive, to put together a toolkit based on the rules and the regulations that the department has found to be utilized to help enforce the law and to help mitigate or manage the escalation of the situation. So that’s where eventually the Strategic Enforcement Strategy became to be.",29-239-22,239,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER OMAR ALGHABRA,minister omar alghabra
29-240-15,"And we heard from your deputy about the development of what I think was originally called the Maximum Enforcement Strategy, ended up evolving into the Strategic Enforcement Strategy, about seeing what laws from various jurisdictions could be brought to bear on the situation. And we don’t need to rerun the evidence that he gave us because he gave us quite a thorough account of it, but the point I remember him mentioning -- and I'll ask you to comment on from the ministerial perspective, is that just the way the Department of Transport works, because it has to take its federal responsibility and coordinate that with all of the provinces and territories, there's already a very strong network within the Department of Transport with all of the partner agencies or equivalent agencies, including law enforcement and regulation in each of the provinces and territories. And would that level of connectivity and intergovernmental relations also apply at the ministerial level?",29-240-17,240,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR.

GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
29-241-20,"Yes. You know, after the first week, it's become clear that the situation, as I said, has become a lot more complex and a lot more volatile. And it seemed that there was a bit of confusion about whose responsibility it is to deal with enforcing the law, or is there capacity enough locally to enforce the law? So we -- I was proactive in reaching out to my provincial counterpart, particularly in Alberta, in Ontario, in BC as well, and in Manitoba.",29-241-22,241,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

29-242-01,"Let's start with your efforts to engage with Ontario. The timeframe I'm going to concentrate on, just to get the matter focused quickly, is the sort of February 7th, 8th, 9th timeframe. So we are at the point where the convoy has put down roots, so to speak, in Ottawa. There are other events at Coutts and Emerson. And if I could ask the clerk to call up SSM.CAN.00005289, and Minister Alghabra, this will be a text, a series of texts between you and Minister Mulroney, Caroline Mulroney of the Province of Ontario. And would you describe here as your counterpart in the Ontario government?",29-242-03,242,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron

29-242-14,"And if you can just look at the text there, see if that reminds you of the exchange you had -- it might not be necessary for us to go to the ones on the 8th and 9th, though if that would help you remember, we can -- can you tell us what you are attempting to do with Minister Mulroney of the Ontario government with respect to the effort you've just been describing?",29-242-16,242,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
29-242-21,"Sure. I talked about the -- how the idea of strategic enforcement strategies come to being. I just want to add another context to this, is that we were looking for tools that will help end the blockades and the occupation with as minimum confrontation as possible too. So that’s where the idea of utilizing some of the provincial powers that they have in regulating commercial vehicles became obvious, because it really will -- creating -- I mean, I don’t want to call it incentive, but certainly, dissuade people who are using commercial vehicles from using them illegally and hopefully discourage people who are thinking of joining the occupation to realize that there is significant consequences. So that’s where the idea has come about. And I wanted to -- when we finalized or developed this, it wasn’t completely finalized, but when we have the outline of what we were thinking I reached out to Minister Mulroney to share with her what we have put in place or what we are proposing. So I texted her on Monday. By the way also that day I had participated in a press conference with my colleagues, Minister LeBlanc and Minister Mendicino. We felt it was -- up until that moment the Federal Government had not spoken out publicly about our role or in dealing with the blockades and the occupation. So I reached out to her and I asked if she would have time to speak with me so I can share with her what I thought was constructive ideas.",29-242-23,242,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

29-245-07,"Right. But one thing, I was wondering if your deputy or your staff briefed you on, was the concern certainly that the lawyers observing the situation could have had, which is that if you start using enforcement mechanisms for what might be called an ulterior purpose or for some objective other than those mechanisms were designed for, you run into legal issues, including the procedural fairness that has to be applied before the enforcement can be effective, before it can take effect.

And we, as I said, it was clear that we had a different opinion on how to deal with it. She thought that this was a federal jurisdiction and I was saying that the roads, the blockaders and the occupiers were on were under municipal or provincial jurisdiction and that we hope that the province would take the lead and utilize their existing laws and enforcement to apply the law.

If things aren't addressed in the very near term, we as the federal government will step in.""

The Secretary certainly was anxious and wanted to know when -- if I could give an estimate, when will this end, and how quickly can port of entry be reopened, and I was explaining to him the complexity of enforcement and whose responsibility and that our Federal Government is not able to direct police to how to operate their law enforcement. So I gave him a context of how this -- the complexity of the situation, but at the same time, I wanted to give him -- to reassure him that this was an important matter, and that, yes, despite the complexity, that we're going to put - - we're going to do everything we can at the federal level to fix this issue. So it was -- for me, it was intended not, I could say, even if we had started the conversation, I wasn't sure where we're going to go at the federal level, but I wanted to give him a sense of confidence that this is a priority for us and that we will do what we can to deal with it as quickly as possible.",29-250-29,250,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

So that was the eventual concern for Secretary Buttigieg and for me, to be precise. And yes, we could see that now new tools are provided to law enforcement, but we still couldn't see the end, you know, of the blockades. There was a lot of fluidity and volatility in what was happening in Windsor or across the country, to be honest, because at different blockades, even though in Windsor we would hear reduction in size, growth in size, a clearance on one side, but maybe still a tenuous situation where the...

29-254-27,"Sure. I mean, that is the -- I guess the question that I had to deal with, and so did my colleagues. And I kind of alluded to it in my previous response, again, that moment in time, there was a lot of concern about ongoing escalation and inspiration that these blockades and occupations had been causing. And it felt, as I said, that there’s -- it wasn’t just Ottawa. It wasn’t just Windsor. It was Sarnia. It was Cornwall. It was Emerson. It was Coutts. It was Surrey. It was the Port of Vancouver. It was the Port of Halifax. All that to say is that there had been reports of either threats or some form of floral, some form of protest, and it felt that there was a stalemate, and that stalemate was raising the temperature, occupiers and blockaders were becoming more entrenched. Those who opposed them were also becoming more entrenched in opposing them. so there was a sense of a stalemate and a risk to many people, including those who were participating in the blockades, that this could get out of hand, that we could be reaching a tipping point where it could escalate and we would look back and regret not doing something sooner. And not to mention, by the way, the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Canadians, who have been personally impacted, either through their livelihood or their quality of life, businesses that I heard from. So there’s been -- this situation across the country was getting into really period of a lot of, I would say, concern, about where this is going to head if we don’t end up doing something. And I know I grappled with that decision. I didn’t take that decision lightly. And I would say I was reluctant to that decision. But it was the right thing to do to protect Canada’s national interests, to protect Canada’s security, to protect Canadians.

29-258-23,"Now, an issue that you might have heard talked about -- it depends how closely you've been following the proceedings. I think what is not contentious is that not long after the enactment of the -- or the invocation of the Emergencies Act, trucks did get towed and that some documentation indicates -- mostly documentation where the tow truck drivers are seeking to get paid for their services -- that at least the mechanism for compensating tow truck drivers who were asked to provide services or compelled to provide services under the Act, that that part of the system worked. But I wonder if you followed the evidence closely enough to have observed the observations made by some of the police, in particular Ottawa and OPP. Witnesses who have spoken about the fact that they already had tow trucks lined up and available, willing to provide service and that in fact those arrangements pre-existed the Emergencies Act and could have been used without the enactment of the Emergencies Act.

Throughout these weeks of outreach and discussions and debates, no one has said that the tow truck issue was resolved. In fact, in all of my conversations prior to the invocation of the Emergencies Act availability of tow trucks was always highlighted as an issue and that tow truck operators were worried about their safety or worried about their business. Those trucks, particularly the ones in Ottawa needed specialized tow truck and tow truck drivers. And that it was an issue, having access to tow trucks that could do this was an issue. And again, the tow trucks did not appear until after the invocation of the Emergencies Act. So I can’t speak to what the others have been testifying but I can tell you that that’s what I had heard.

29-260-16,"I just want to go back to the picture that I tried to draw for you about the situation and how heightened the sense of anxiety and concern for public safety, for economic well-being of our country was, how at the time, cities and municipalities were asking us to do something. Provincial governments were saying this is a federal issue. Opposition parties were asking us questions, “Why aren’t you doing something?” Canadians were asking us. Businesses were asking. We didn’t talk about several interactions that I had with associations that represented different industries including the trucking industry. They were all, you know -- and I looked them in the eye and I heard it in their voice, the panic, the fear, the concern that they have, the shifts that were shut down, the businesses that were closed down, the people who couldn’t go to hospitals. That was the moment that we were living. And it felt like we had to do something. We were -- again, it was not something that we took lightly. It was not something that I took lightly. But it was the context that we’re in, the fear of escalation, the fear of getting to a tipping point where it could get out of hand. That was -- I strongly believe that that was invoking the Emergencies Act again that was very precise and limited, was necessary. As to your second question, I think it’s clear that this incident has exposed some gaps, whether it is, you know, the issue of jurisdictions, whether it is -- do we need additional tools to protect critical infrastructure? I think those are important questions and in fact I’ve tasked my department to do some work on what can be done to strengthen federal legislation or tools to add additional maybe tools, set of tools to protect critical infrastructure.",29-260-18,260,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

You talked about the fact that you have at least an annual of a council of Ministers of Transportation at the federal and provincial and territorial level. Do you think that if, at the next one of your meetings, you put your heads together to see if you could come up with plans, procedures, and protocols so that you're not trying to invent this thing from the start the next time a problem like this arises, that the officials themselves perhaps even without new legislation or perhaps with a view to fashioning appropriate legislation could advance the situation?",29-261-21,261,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And I think it’s really important to collaborate with provincial governments on clarifying these -- what appear to be misconceptions or miscommunication or misunderstanding, but also identifying tools. I’ll just note, for example, the Alberta government has its own critical infrastructure legislation.

Second, you know, we don’t make public policy based on the number of protesters or emails that we get. We make public policy, particularly during the pandemic -- and let me be the first to acknowledge, governments around the world, including the federal government, did extraordinary measures in what we believed was the right thing to protect the health and safety of Canadians. I never imagined provinces shutting down businesses. I never imagined provinces invoking curfews. I never imagined the federal government putting limitations on travel. But we all did that. Governments across Canada did these measures because we believed we are saving lives. And yes, they were extraordinary, but I can tell you, no one, at least us -- I am not -- I’m not making any apology for doing what we believed the best thing for protecting lives. Now, of course, it caused inconvenience. Of course, it caused disruption. And our government did whatever we can to mitigate those disruptions, and Canadians understood that. Canadians understood that.

Should the government listen to public and consider the sentiment of public? Of course, but we are guided by the interest of -- of the interests of Canadians -- protecting the interests of Canadians.

So -- and I have had several meetings with representatives of trucking associations, of trucking companies, and they all felt that they're giving the trucking industry a bad name. Second, let me just highlight a second point, by the way. We actually eased our international travel measures, and I can't remember the exact day, but sometime in February where there was a requirement for on-arrival testing.

So it was really critical for me personally and for our government, to keep monitoring our supply chain and the health of our supply chain and in fact one of the rationale that we believed the vaccine mandate would be good for our supply chain, is to protect the health and safety of the workers in the supply chains. With absenteeism being high because of Covid, with spread of Covid, with the risk of contracting Covid, the vaccine mandate, one of its rationale is that it ensured some additional resilience within our supply chain, including for our truck drivers. So when we -- and there was coordination; you’re asking about truck drivers across the borders; there was coordination between us and the U.S.; they also required similar measures for truck drivers to cross the border. Prior to invoking -- or implementing that measure, I had many consultations with trucking associations, with industry and it had come to me that about 90 per cent of truck drivers were fully vaccinated, that this measure would not have a measurable impact, however, we’ll continue to encourage the remaining who have not been vaccinated to get vaccinated. So all that long preamble to say is that I kept an eye on the volume of our truck activities across the border on a regular basis and published those on my social media to reassure the public that while the vaccine mandate is working, it has not had a measurable impact on the flow of our goods and our truck drivers across the border.",29-288-14,288,14,12,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

But this, as I alluded earlier, this was a conversation with representatives of Toyota and Honda. And they were explaining to about the severe impact that these blockaders are having on their business, the shortage of parts, the impact on assembly lines, the impact on workers, and the impact on confidence. And again, don’t forget, we’re at a time where there’s a transformation in the auto sector, the building of new vehicles, electric vehicles. There’s competition between different jurisdictions.

So that was the extent of the conversation. With Nova Scotia, you know, there were also threats of blockades and protests around ports, around the legislator. They had, I think, invoked their own state of emergency. So I just reached out as well as part of my effort to reach out to many of the provinces who were impacted to speak with her, to get a sense from her about what she and her government felt about the invocation of the Emergencies Act and about the current situation in the province.

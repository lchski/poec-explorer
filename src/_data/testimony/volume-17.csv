17-073-13,"Correct. And what we found out was on last Friday, October 28th at 12:37 p.m., we received an email from the Commission saying that these two individuals would be called as witnesses, and attaching two statements from these individuals. No information had been previously provided about these individuals, or about the issues that they were going to testify about, which are the -- how their arrest was handled, nor were there any documents provided by the parties, including the Ottawa Police Service, about the manner of arrest. It appears that both of these individuals, from their statements, are going to give evidence about the circumstances of their arrest by unknown officers. I’ve been able to determine in one case that it was not an OPS officer, one of them, but we are trying to find out information. These are arrests that took place on February 18th, after the invocation of the Emergencies Act. These individuals were not arrested pursuant to the Emergencies Act. They were arrested based on common-law powers and the Criminal Code. And my concerns really are two-fold. Firstly, the information we say is not relevant to your mandate under the Act, and the second question is one of procedural fairness. There were over 275 arrests made by the police in that period of February 18th to the 20th. None of the police witnesses were asked specifically about those arrests, no documents were requested. The last police witness who testified in this proceeding was on Wednesday, October 26th. Had those witness statements been provided prior to the completion of the police witnesses, then at the very least, we could have asked our witnesses to provide evidence with respect to the arrest plan, with respect to the circumstances of the arrest of those two individuals, and the other 275 people who were arrested. I am not faulting Commission Counsel. I understand that the statements were provided to them and they provided them to us immediately after. But it was two days after the last witness testified. Those statements were in the -- those were witnesses who are here represented by counsel, they had an obligation to produce documents. They chose, deliberately or otherwise, to not present that evidence and not allow me, then to respond to it. And it’s obvious that some of that information, they had beforehand. And in fact, to add to the procedural unfairness, last night, we received an email from counsel for the Convoy organizers attaching seven more videos that also would have existed that were not disclosed. There’s no explanation for why the Convoy organizers have not had to follow the same rules as everyone else. Those statements, even if they were relevant, and I don’t concede that they are, should have been provided prior to police witnesses testifying. It creates a serious and irreparable breach of procedural fairness to have you left with two arrests out of 275, which I am unable to provide evidence in response to, both those specific arrests, as well as the arrest plan in general. And there are, I say, two possible solutions. The first is to not allow that evidence to be heard. It’s not relevant to your mandate. And even if it was, it would be very difficult to draw any conclusion from the evidence of two individuals out of 275 arrests when you’ve heard no evidence about any of the arrests of anyone else, or the arrest plans, or any explanation of those two particular arrests. Alternatively, if you are inclined to allow that panel to testify, including adding new documents that were not on the database and were provided last night, then the OPS must, we say, as a matter of procedural fairness, be allowed the opportunity to call another witness to provide evidence about the arrest plans and the exercise of use of force options in connection with the exercise of police powers generally and specifically with respect to the scene that the officers encountered on February 18. You have not heard about what is involved when a Public Order Unit has to exercise tactical options. The Commission didn’t lead this evidence, nor did we. Similarly, we didn’t provide any documents surrounding those arrests. So while my first submission is that you should not allow this evidence, as an alternative, if you are inclined to do so, then I would ask for the opportunity to call evidence so that in fairness, the police witnesses can address what should have bene put to them by the Convoy organizers and which, for some reason, was not.

17-078-01,"We’re of course in support of the witnesses testifying and all of the evidence being put before the Commission. I’ll deal first with the point of law my friend raises about relevance and materiality. With respect to the terms of reference under the Order in Council in this Commission, this Commission is to look at the efforts of police and other responders prior to and after the declaration. So with respect to whether or not there was police brutality or misconduct, et cetera, it’s relevant and material within the terms of reference. Second, with respect to my friend’s allegations of prejudice and it not being fair, with respect, they have not called a single victim or a single eye-witness to any of these reported violent crimes that they’re trying to lay at the hands of the protestors as a collective. I don’t see how our clients being able to find some witnesses of which they had no control over and which approached them, trying to be able to call actual evidence of actual violence that isn’t just an assertation. And in my respectful view, it’s relevant material. If you find that there is some form of prejudice suffered, what my friend is essentially alleging is a violation of the rule of Browne and Dunn. If this was a court, that leaves the court with various remedies, and one is to permit the recalling of a witness in rebuttal. With respect to the rule of Browne and Dunn, I did put issues with respect to arrest, et cetera, directly to Chief Bell, who was in charge of the operation at the time, and acting and asking questions about what was actually done. We’ve now provided the videos of those actual arrests. I understand that all the police agencies don’t want that to be in the public eye and, with respect, I would submit that the public has a right to see these videos. It is in the public interest and any prejudice is easily repairable by permitting my friends to call a rebuttal witness if they so choose.

17-079-16,"Hatim Kheir for the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms. We support the Freedom Convoy Organizers position, and if I could just make a few points. So first, the terms of reference in the Emergencies Act do require investigating and looking into the appropriateness of the measures that were used. Interim Chief Bell testified that using emergency powers were used to create an exclusion zone and that they relied on that authority, and so I would expect that these witnesses as arrestees would have evidence that would be relevant to the implementation of that authority. Also, to the extent that my friend made the point that these are but two arrestees of many, we did hear from two Ottawa residents who provided their experiences as examples, and that would then represent a broader class of individuals, so this would also be two arrestees providing their experiences which would then be emblematic of others in a similar position. And I would just like to add on, my friend, Mr. Honner, from The Democracy Fund provided submissions through email. He’s not here. I would just briefly read it in just to provide his perspective as well: “The Democracy Fund submitted that the evidence of these witnesses is relevant to the Commission’s mandate. Specifically, the Commissioner has been directed to examine issues to the extent relating to the efforts of police and other responders prior to and after the declaration. Superintendent Robert Bernier and others testified about the mission statement contained in the OPS Operational Plan of February 13th which speaks to enforcing legislation with the ‘utmost respect to the individual’s Charter of Rights’. There was evidence before the Commission that this plan evolved after the declaration of the Emergencies Act and there was also evidence that the OPS found the powers available to them under the Emergencies Act to be useful. The Commission should hear evidence from these witnesses, as it will speak to how police enforcement was carried out during the state of emergency from a protestor perspective. If there are objections as to relevance as the evidence unfolds, those objections can be dealt with orally. If other witnesses need to be recalled, that decision can be made after the hearing of evidence from the witnesses in question.” (As read) So that was Mr. Honner’s submission, which the Justice Centre also supports.",17-079-18,79,18,16,speaker_start,SUBMISSIONS BY MR.

The one point I want to respond to that has not, with respect, been addressed by my friends and which is highly problematic, I suggest, is the convoy lawyer has indicated that he put an issue with respect to an arrest to Chief Bell. And that is correct. However, he provided no information, no details, no indication of who it was, when it was. It came out of the air. And what makes that more problematic is that, obviously, that information was in his possession and there was no documentation provided beforehand. This was sprung after the police witnesses had already testified when we then get these statements. Had the rules been followed, that witness would have seen those statements, would have seen documents. We would have had the opportunity to put in documents and call evidence or asked to call evidence in response.

So the use of the notices, the setting up of exclusion zones, is squarely within the mandate. And therefore, I think the information may well be relevant. I also note that there has been evidence of police as to the fact that the protest was ended in an orderly manner and quite properly. I believe Insp. Beaudin talked about that. I believe another witness, maybe Chief Bell talked about the fact it was ended without burning of police cars, et cetera. So the manner of ending is relevant, and this may go to some degree. I think the -- and there was also cross- examination in -- I believe of Insp. Bernier, as to the arrangements that were made and the processing, how the processing was done, the -- so there is evidence about how the operation, if you like, was carried out, including how the detainees were treated and the system arranged. Now, having said that, the impact and relevance diminishes to a point where it’s -- it in fact becomes questionable as we get further along, further from the use of the Emergency Act notice, et cetera, because this Commission is not mandated to deal with arrests that were or were not done in accordance with the appropriate police procedures and so on. That’s a matter for similar criminal courts, if there have been issues in that regard. So I think it moves quite -- well, I would say of marginal relevance, if any, to what the Commission is doing when you talk about the actual manner of arrest, as opposed to what I’ve described that is more squarely in the relevance. So having said that, I’m not prepared to accept that it is -- that these -- this panel is not relevant. I expect the accent will be on what I have set out is clearly relevant and what’s related to that. And obviously there will be some context. Context has been provided by other witnesses sometimes. And while I may hear that, it may not become an issue that I have to deal with. Now, on the second point, the procedural fairness point, I have some concern about that, because obviously it is, as I’ve said many times, and I’m going to repeat it, the public wants to get to the bottom of this, and that means fair to all parties. And I am concerned that there may be unfairness to the -- to some of the parties. In particular, the police forces, whether it be the OPP or the OPS, or in fact, to former Chief Sloly, or anyone else. So fairness is front and center in my concerns, and if after we hear this evidence there’s a need to call further evidence, we’ve said we would sit evenings, and we will sit Saturdays. We will get to -- get the information that the public needs to know and that will lead to a fair treatment for all. That’s -- I guess that’s my ruling. Now, if you want something more formal in writing, I’m happy to do it. But I sense the panel is here waiting, and we want to get -- we all want to make sure we fully use our Friday. I thought I’d give my ruling now. If anybody wants it in writing and expanded upon, I’m happy to do that. But I think that sets out, really, my thinking in a general way. And with respect to whether we will have another panel or another witness, I think that’s something we can deal with after the evidence is heard. With respect to the videos, I’m a bit concerned about the videos. I haven’t seen them. And I would hope we’re not going to get too far afield to what’s relevant to the issues I need to deal with. I don’t mean to minimize any issues about how an arrest was carried out. Those are obviously significant to individuals involved, including the officers, but that’s not central. In fact, is more anecdotal, I think, in terms of what this Commission is dealing with, but it is part of the record so far, some of the evidence relating to that. So that’s my ruling. And we can proceed with the panel, I believe. And I will expect the parties, if there are concerns about the ruling and you wish it in writing, please notify Commission Counsel. Well, it will be in writing because it will be in the transcript, but expanded upon.",17-086-10,86,10,8,speaker_start,SUBMISSIONS BY MR. BRENDAN MILLER,COMMISSIONER ROULEAU,commissioner rouleau

And further to that, just listening to the Senators give their speeches, I felt that -- that as they were supposed to approve it, but then it was removed before they had a chance to approve it or not, it sounded like there was good reason to stick to what I felt was right and stay. And I don’t believe that -- if a government passes a law it means that we have to go against what we believe is right. We should still -- you know, we still have a right to peacefully protest and assemble.

I did have a chance to refresh his -- to give him my reference points, my photo and my story quickly, but about 45 minutes into the pushing, I kind of underestimated the amount of physical toll it would take on my body after 14 years of not being able to do what I could do when I was 20. My muscles and my body was just -- I had given up. I was finished. And the video would show that I succumb, and I gave myself to the police. And as the police took me down, again, he knew, he kneed me in my side, kicked me in my back. I was laying down. I was in the fetal position on my back. He kicked me in my ankle and my foot. As I was laying down, I had my hands completely up. I'm saying, ""I'm very peaceful. I'm peaceful. I'm not resisting."" I was then punched four or five times in my head. I had a knee on my back to keep myself down. I was on the ground for one-and-a- half to two minutes. My hands were zip tied. The officers slowly picked me up and then we slowly proceeded to the processing line. We get to the processing line. The day was minus 20. I had no gloves on. At the beginning of the processing line, we're standing there, and I had asked -- so and -- sorry, the duration of the processing line was one-and-a-half to two hours, so I was standing there in the cold for two hours. I asked the policeman who was on both sides of me, I said, ""Do you mind, you know my conditions, is it okay if I sit or kneel because I'm in chronic pain?"" It was obvious. My face was flushed, and I had cried multiple times, and I don't cry ever. I was -- it was the worst pain I had felt since I'd been blown up. The fact that I couldn't sit, or stand was, to me, cruel and unusual punishment. We would go 15, 20 minutes without even moving. I also asked if I could have my medication, in which I had my prescription and my medication on my person, so that if I needed it, I could ask. I asked, and I was denied my medication to comfort my duress. We finished the processing line after about two hours. Police took my -- on the whiteboard they put down my name, they took my photo.

17-133-18,"I believe last we time we spoke, so when the processing line was finished, after the two hours of standing in the freezing cold, not able to sit or kneel, and denied my medication again, I was then -- I had my information taken, I was then placed in the back of a squad car. They read me what I was being charged with, which was public obstruction and mischief. So I said I understood. The police officer then -- the police officer then left the vehicle for five minutes. He came back and he said, “Well, today’s your lucky day. You’re not being charged.” I said, “That’s great.” I said, “Can I know what’s -- why that changed?” He said, “No, you don’t need to know that.” So at that time, I felt that it was my understanding that I’m free to go because I’m not being charged with anything. Then the next five, 10 minutes they put me in a paddy wagon with no direction. They didn’t say, “Go in here.” So, again, I mean, I had no choice. I go in the paddy wagon. I’m there for 25 minutes. I don’t know where I’m going, don’t know how long I’m there. Eventually, the paddy wagon does fill up over the next couple of hours. Then they drive us around for approximately half an hour to 40 minutes. It was very hard to tell because there’s no windows, of course, in the paddy wagon; you know, there’s no concept of time. They then drove us to a Public Works building that was 10.2 kilometres away from Parliament Hill. When they let us out of the paddy wagons, they gave us our possession back. They gave us no paperwork. The police officer came out and he gave us a stern warning and said, “You don’t come back to Ottawa, or you’ll be charged.” They gave us all our possessions back and -- sorry; most of us, due to the cold, our cell phones had died. No-one had any money; no-one had any masks. We couldn’t go into the building to make a phone call. So we were stranded. So we were forced to walk to a Wendy’s that was -- and I forget the approximate distance; we had to walk from that Public Works building in the snow, in the freezing cold to a Wendy’s. I had a called a friend that I had just met prior the night -- on the 17th, I met someone for five minutes and he said, “If you need anything in Ottawa...” And this is the type of people we met in Ottawa. I met him for two minutes, five minutes, and he said, “If you need anything, you call me and I’ll pick you up right away,” and whatever. And he did exactly that. I picked him up -- I called him at Wendy’s, I said, “Can you please us up? We have no money. We have no means. We don’t know where we are, we’re not from Ottawa.” It was just -- I never thought that I would get dumped out of the seat like trash by my -- by the police.

These are traditionally conservative areas in Canada, Republican in the United States, so we, you know, kind of found it amusing that there was this kind of geographically divide, almost, that you could find on a map and, you know, it became sort of joke that if this was a pretend, you know, a kind of parallel universe, a different world, and so on, and that’s how the concept was born. The flag you’re referencing is what I created in the weeks following on my phone just as kind of a -- as a mechanism for branding symbolism kind of thing for, you know, community members and it started to become synonymous with myself and the podcast kind of as a -- as I guess a branding mechanism that people would, you know, display and they could buy patches, stickers, and things like this to basically denote that they’re a fan of mine.",17-154-26,154,26,24,speaker_start,"EXAMNIATION IN-CHIEF BY.

I observed that there was a few dozen people that came from as far away as British Columbia, Ontario, even in Saskatchewan, and it struck me as in this time of a lot of people feel very isolated and depressed. A lot of them expressed to me how much this meant for them to feel as though they had some kind of connection and kinship with other people that felt the same way as they did about the future and shared their fears and concerns. So and I just observed how much it seemed to help them, heal them, and make them happy. So I began what I called a ""find your friends"" campaign. So I used -- using my online presence and my telegram channel and so on, set up kind of regional areas or chat channels to facilitate my -- I mean, not everyone can come all the way to Saskatchewan from PEI, Newfoundland, or so on. So if there's people that are like minded, that are in your area that share this, they're a fan of my podcast and so on and would like to meet each other and share in this kind of activity, then you can do so this way. I was just trying to create a -- you know, an avenue for them to pursue, and I encouraged people to do that rather than sitting at home looking a their screens and you know, being fed, you know, fear and what I believe is a lot of toxic messaging on the media and television and so on. And I thought it would be good for people to get out and have real, face-to-face human interactions and relationships again.

I worked hard. I was passionate about my craft. I think I had a reputation of being a hard-working professional. Then beyond that, my -- my wife and I were no longer permitted access to public spaces that we as taxpaying Canadians were helping fund. And that prevented us from being involved in our children’s activities such as minor hockey, which we were both heavily involved in for a number of years, roughly six years. We couldn’t travel to see our family in northern Alberta, which, you know, living in the second-largest land mass country in the world, was problematic, so it’s roughly 40 hours of drive time. And we lost neighbours and friends who were perfectly fine to have relationships with us until the vaccine passport deadline kicked in, and then we were no longer worthy to speak to. And beyond that, there was a very heightened state of anxiety about how much further the situation in Canada would degenerate. And what I mean by that is that the dehumanization effort had begun, and that was in -- I believe that was in August of 2021 when the Prime Minister had initially announced the federal -- the impending federal vaccination mandate and then he was campaigning into September for his snap election.

In my mind, Ottawa residents have seen that type of police presence probably on a regular basis at large-scale events, but a lot of these people that travelled to Ottawa have likely never been here before and likely never participated in an event of this magnitude. So I just wanted everyone to understand that when you have a massive crowd such as this come to the National Capital Region for a large event, it’s normal to have multiple police agencies involved, it’s normal to have specialized units moving around in more tactical-looking clothing, and it’s normal to have snipers on rooftops because that was something that a lot of people were really panicked about.

And then after the -- I think it was a Council meeting or a Police Services Board meeting, there was a lot of rhetoric regarding the Freedom Convoy protesters’ allegations of being extremists, insurrectionists, I believe even the term, “Domestic terrorism” may have been thrown around. And I noticed at that time, that was -- that also coincided with a lot of that same rhetoric from the legacy media, and, you know, we’d already heard and seen the Prime Minister using similar language. And so I felt that that was -- that was definitely heightening the anxiety of the overall crowd, the fear that they were going to be labelled such and dealt with as such by law enforcement because they were under so much pressure from the -- from the different levels of government. And there was also -- I believe that was right around the same time that there was also -- they were being denied access to service, some of the portable toilets. So, I mean, you’re denying people their basic sanitation needs. And there was also information beginning to circulate about the involvement of CAS, or Children’s Aid Society, I believe is what that stands for. And that, to me, was -- that was a clear red flag to me that if you are deliberately trying to provoke people to take action, if you make them believe that you’re going to take their kids away, that’s going to elicit a very strong emotional response, and I believe that that was deliberately done in order to bully the Freedom Convoy protesters.",17-249-04,249,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Now, I'm not sure if you were present or you had watched this part of the hearing when I referred to these text messages. This is a text exchange between one of the staffers with the Prime Minister's Office, and another one of the staffers with the Minister of Public Safety's Office; okay? And this is in this context the staffer with the Prime Minister's Office states to the staffer with Public Safety Minister's Office that: ""Got a quick [response], people are into it. [Let me know] if your boss is too."" Boss being the Minister of Public Safety: ""Happy to help however I can! This is what I sent through [by the way]: 'Hi, I just had a chat with Alex at PS..."" Being Public Safety: ""'...who had a bit of an interesting idea. As you saw in the pod goals chat, the [trucker] convoy and some of their more extreme comments...(calling for Jan 6 style insurrection) are getting more coverage in the media. Alex was surveying whether [there would] be some interest in his boss doing some media on this eventually. He was chatting with Mendicino about it right before he went into [a] cabinet retreat.'""

Being Minister Blair and the Prime Minister: ""'...said last year when Jan. 6th occurred:'"" And the first point is: ""'""Our democracy is something we need to nurture and protect every day.""'"" And then if we could bring up the second part of the text message, at 7724. And then it goes on, and this is the points that are being relayed and -- or that is essentially going to be the narrative: ""'We will always support the right to peaceful protest. [And] some of the calls that organizers of these events are making are concerning, and [we'll take] them seriously (would need something to back this up). We'll continue to monitor the situation closely. The fine line to walk would be to ensure we are not looking like we are directing the police, which obviously is not the goal here. Hoping to canvass your thoughts - Alex said he'd come back to me with a proposal this afternoon when he gets to chat with Mendicino again, obviously pending his boss's and our interests in looking into this further.'"" So that text is to either the Prime Minister or someone within his office and they're explaining what Alex, the Chief of Staff for the Public Safety Minister, has come up with. And he responds: ""Thanks!! I had an initial chat with my boss and he's supportive, but wants to wait a day or two. There's a danger that if we come down too hard they might push out the crazies."" Being, I think, the far extreme factions online they were talking about. ""I think that's fair"", she responds: ""Apparently [G]lobal & others are working on stories. Maybe we see how those land.""

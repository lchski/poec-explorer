16-007-14,"Mr. Commissioner, today the Commission is presenting its next overview report dealing with fundraising in support of protesters. Next slide, please. COMOR00000005 describes the major fundraising activities that took place to provide money to support protestors in Ottawa. This overview report describes a variety of entities that were involved in this process including crowdfunding platforms, financial institutions, payment processors, as well as cryptocurrencies. The report provides a narrative of meetings and decision-making that took place with respect to how these fundraisers would be organized and constructed, and how money would be distributed, and it provides information available to the Commission about the ultimate sources and disposition of approximately $24M in donations. Next slide. Before getting into the results of the investigation, a few words about the process that the Commission used. It began by reviewing information provided by the parties to the proceeding, however, a great deal of the information necessary to complete this investigation was not in the hands of the parties. The Commission, using its powers of summons, as well as negotiations, obtained additional documents from six non-parties to this proceeding as well as engaging in a open- source investigation for further information. Commission counsel also interviewed 10 witnesses who provided statements that then were used to complete this report. Next slide, please. There were certainly a number of fundraisers that were in play during the Ottawa protests. This overview report focuses, however, on four main sources of funding, the GoFundMe and email money transfer campaigns associated with the Freedom Convoy, the Adopt a Trucker crowdfunding and email money transfer campaign, the second Freedom Convoy fundraiser posted on the GiveSendGo platform, and a subset of cryptocurrency campaigns that raised virtual currencies in support of protestors. Next slide. This represents the results of the investigation. Each line depicts a different source of funds and tracks how those funds were distributed and how they were dealt with at various points by a number of different intermediaries. The thickness of each line represents the amount of funding in question. I’ll return to this slide towards the end of my presentation to review exactly what the Commission learned about the sources and final destinations of funds. Next slide, please. Before turning to that, however, it’s useful to review some of the individuals and entities that played significant roles in the fundraising associated with the Freedom Convoy. Some of those individuals include Tamara Lich, who was the creator of the original GoFundMe and email money transfer campaigns for the Freedom Convoy; Chris Garrah, the organizer of the Adopt a Trucker Campaign and its associated funraisers; Chad Eros, an accountant who provided advice to the Freedom Convoy organizer, created the Convoy Corporation and played a significant role in the creation of the GiveSendGo campaign; and Jacob Wells, the co-founder of GiveSendGo who was also involved in the move of the Freedom Convoy crowdfunding campaign to his platform. Next slide, please. There are also a number of companies that were involved in the various forms of fundraising. You’ve already heard me refer to GoFundMe and GiveSendgo which are two crowdfunding platforms that take in donations in support of causes. There are also Canadian financial institutions that had important roles, such as the Toronto Dominion Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada. These were two financial institutions that received some of the funds. And finally, payment processors like Stripe and it’s Canadian subsidiary, Stripe Payment Canada Limited, played an important role in the background to these fundraisers, as I’ll discuss later in my presentation and is set out in more detail in the overview report. Next slide, please. One thing that will become apparent as one reviews the overview report is that frequently there were events that were taking place in parallel. It is not a strictly linear story that can be told, but rather one has to understand that different actors were engaged in different forms of fundraising conduct at the same time. The first part of the story that the overview report details has to do with the period January 14 to February 2nd of 2022 associated with the creation of the Freedom Convoy GoFundMe campaign and its associated e-transfer campaign. Next slide, please. The story begins with Tamara Lich and the creation of a crowd funding campaign on the GoFundMe platform on January 14th of 2022. At the same time, or rather four days later, Ms. Lich also made a post to Facebook that put forward an email address that solicited direct email money transfer donations in support of the Freedom Convoy. Both the GiveSendGo campaign and the email money transfer campaign were associated with a bank account at the Toronto Dominion Bank in Ms. Lich’s name. And both campaigns began to receive funds on the days that they were created. Nest slide, please. In its interview with Commission counsel, representatives from GoFundMe indicated that they became aware of the crowd funding campaign on their platform within hours of its creation. This was because it was flagged through its algorithms due to the very high rate of donations that were made very early in its creation. This flagging caused individuals within GoFundMe to review the campaign and relatively early on those individuals began to be concerned about the ability of this fundraiser to comply with the GoFundMe terms of service. In particular, the concern related to the GoFundMe terms related to campaigns distributing money in accordance with their description. When an individual creates a crowd funding campaign they have to describe what it is that they’re going to do with the money that’s raised. GoFundMe requires people who organize campaigns on their platform to actually distribute money in accordance with what they tell the public they will do with it. In the case of the Freedom Convoy fundraiser the description said that it would do certain things with the money such as: “We are asking for donations to help with the costs of fuel, food, and lodgings. Funds will be spent to help cover the costs of fuel for our truckers first and foremost will be used to assist with food if needed, and contribute to shelter if needed. Any leftover donations will be donated to a credible veteran’s organization which will be chosen by the donors.” GoFundMe reported that it had concerns with these statements. They indicated that, for example, they were uncertain how it would be possible for what was now thousands of donors to all agree on a credible veteran’s organization that could receive leftover funds. Because of these initial concerns they tasked what they called their VIP team to reach out to Ms. Lich. This is a group of GoFundMe employees who are responsible for dealing with high profile fundraisers and they reached out to Ms. Lich starting on January 16th of 2022 to discuss the fundraiser and how the funds might be spent. Next slide, please. These communications continued between the 16th and January 27th, initially with Ms. Lich abut very quickly turned over to a group of other individuals who were working with her to manage the campaign and to deal with GoFundMe. Over the course of this period, GoFundMe representatives posted questions and received answers. And by January 27th they had reached the part where they felt comfortable releasing at least some of the money that had been raised. Up until this point, donations remained in the control of GoFundMe. On January 27th, in order to formalize the assurances that Ms. Lich and her associates had provided GoFundMe, they provided something that they referred to as the attestation letter. The attestation letter was a document that they asked Ms. Lich to sign that set out a number of obligations on her part that she would have to agree to in exchange for access to the first $1 million of funds. This included pledges that she would act as a fiduciary for the beneficiaries of the fundraiser -- that is to say the truckers involved in the Ottawa protests; that she would deliver funds in a manner that was consistent with what she had set out in the fundraiser itself; a series of accountability mechanisms such as requiring truckers to sign registration forms and to provide receipts in order to receive reimbursement; and to make reimbursements through email money transfers to create a form of a digital paper trail that could be tracked. Finally, there was a requirement for the group of advisors that had surrounded her on these matters to form a formal finance committee that would be involved in overseeing the distribution of funds. Ms. Lich signed the attestation letter on January 27th and returned it to GoFundMe. Next slide. It is at this point that GoFundMe decided to release $1 million Canadian to Ms. Lich’s bank account. However, the money did not actually get transmitted on January 27th and this led to some confusion amongst the various actors. As the Commission discovered, while GoFundMe had reached the decision to release the funds on January 27th it wasn’t until February 1st that an actual transaction was initiated. In the time between January 27th and February 1st, Chad Eros, the accountant who had by this point had been brought in by the organizers to assist them in their dealing with GoFundMe, began to express concerns about the idea that funds would be sent directly to Ms. Lich’s personal bank account. In his view it would be more appropriate for there to be a non- profit corporation that would received donated funds and would manage their distribution. To that end, on January 30th, again after the money was agreed to be released but before any release of funds took place, Mr. Eros incorporated the Freedom 2022 Human Rights and Freedoms non-profit corporation which is referred to in the overview report as the Convoy Corporation. As I've mentioned, February 1st was the date which the actual fun fund transfer from GoFundMe was initiated. Records obtained from Toronto Dominion Bank indicate that on that date Chris Barber was added as a second signatory to Mms. Lich’s account that was receiving the funds. Records also showed that second account at TD Bank was opened jointly between Ms. Lich and Mr. Barber on that date. The overview report refers to these as the first and the second TD accounts, respectively. February 2nd, in the early morning hours was when the $1 million was in fact deposited into the first TD account. However, for reasons that I'm going to get into later in my presentation, very little of that money was ever accessed. And on February 3rd, TD Bank itself placed holds on both the first and the second TD account. Next slide, please. Before continuing the story of the GoFundMe fundraiser I'm going to speak a little bit about a second fundraiser that was taking place during the same period of time, the Adopt-A-Trucker fundraiser on the GiveSendGo platform. Next slide, please. Chris Garrah articulated the concept of Adopt-A- Trucker on Facebook. The idea was to pair Ottawa area residents with incoming truckers so that the truckers could receive support like showers, food, and billets. In order to support this concept, Mr. Garrah created a crowd funding campaign on January 18th on GiveSendGo. This campaign was attached to a bank account in his name located at the Royal Bank of Canada. Sometime after the creation of that crowd funding campaign he also, with the assistance of a man known to the Commission as Serge created a website. The website did a number of different things including soliciting email money transfer donations. Those donations were associated with an email address that was also connected to the same RBC account. And again, on January 18th, these campaigns began to raise funds. Next slide, please. So I'm going to return now to the GoFundMe campaign and discuss the events that took place that eventually led to that campaign being shut down. Next slide. Now, I've already indicated that on January 27th, GoFundMe had authorised the release of $1 million in funds. We'll recall that January 28th was the first day on which protesters, as part of the Freedom Convoy, began to arrive in Ottawa. GoFundMe representatives told the Commission that on January 28th they began to receive conflicting media reports about the nature of the protests that were taking place. They were aware of some media reports that described the protests as peaceful, and other reports that described it as involving harassment or unlawful activities. This led GoFundMe to have concerns about term service compliance, not only with respect to whether the funds would be distributed in accordance with the description, but also their requirement that funds not be used to fund unlawful conduct. A series of further communications between GoFundMe and convoy organisers then took place. On January 31st, GoFundMe sent emails to organisers asking a series of questions, and in particular, asking them to confirm that no funds would be given to protesters that were engaged in a range of unlawful activities. One of the activities specifically mentioned by GoFundMe in their communications was blockades of roads. Subsequently, on February 1st, the day in which the $1 million transition was actually initiated, GoFundMe emailed organisers asking a further series of questions, including whether or not they would agree to publicly disavow unlawful conduct that GoFundMe was concerned may be taking place in Ottawa. GoFundMe asked the organisers to respond to their questions within 24 hours. A response was not received within that timeframe, and on February 2nd, the same day that $1 million was received into the First TD account, GoFundMe decided to suspend the fundraiser pending further investigation. Over the course of the next two days, a series of important meetings took place. On February 2nd, representatives of GoFundMe met with Deputy Chief Bell, of the Ottawa Police Service, and on February 3rd, with Mayor Watson, of the City of Ottawa. On February 3rd, the Freedom Convoy organisers also had a series of communications with GoFundMe. A letter drafted by Keith Wilson, acting as counsel for the Convoy Corporation, was sent responding to the questions posed in GoFundMe's February 1st email. Subsequently, a telephone conversation took place involving Mr. Wilson, Mr. Eros, other associates of the fundraisers, and the GoFundMe platform. In their interview with Commission Counsel, GoFundMe representatives indicated that they left that meeting unsatisfied with the responses that they had received, and they continued to have concerns about the lawfulness of the protests and the role that the funds might play in those protests. On February 4th, GoFundMe had a second meeting with Deputy Chief Bell. It was also on that date that representatives of GoFundMe reported that they believed that individuals associated with the Freedom Convoy leadership were using social media to encourage harassment of GoFundMe employees. GoFundMe reported that its employees had received a number of threats after the decision was made to suspend the fundraising campaign, and those threats increased in frequency on February 4th. In the evening of February 4th, GoFundMe made the decision to cancel the fundraiser, and over the course of the next 24 hours arrived at the conclusion that they ought to refund all donations made to the platform. Next slide, please. The Overview Report also describes the events that took place surrounding the move of the Freedom Convoy fundraiser from the GoFundMe platform to the GiveSendGo platform. But as I mentioned before, often events were taking place in parallel, and as it turned out there were critical events involved in that move to GiveSendGo that were taking place as early as January 26th, even before Ms. Lich had signed the attestation letter, let alone the GoFundMe campaign being shut down. Next slide please. In order to understand this part of the story, there is some additional individuals who have to be introduced. On January 26th, a man named John Ballard reached out to Jacob Wells, the co-founder of GiveSendGo. Mr. Ballard is understood by the Commission to be associated with an American-based social media platform called CloutHub. In the January 26th meeting, Mr. Ballard spoke to Mr. Wells about the possibility of the two men working together to convince the Freedom Convoy organisers to move their crowdfunding campaign off of GoFundMe and onto GiveSendGo. In furtherance of this discussion, on January 27th, Mr. Wells created what he described to the Commission as a mock-up of a campaign on his platform, showing what a Freedom Convoy fundraiser would look like on GiveSendGo. Although to be clear, this was not active campaign; it was not capable of receiving funds. On January 28th, Mr. Ballard obtained Mr. Eros's contact information by way of Mr. Garrah. Mr. Ballard contacted Mr. Eros and asked him to join a phone conversation to discuss the possibility of the Freedom Convoy raising funds on GiveSendGo. Mr. Eros agreed to join that conversation. However, before that phone call took place, Mr. Eros reports receiving a phone call from another man named James Peloso, who is associated with the organisation Taking Back Our Freedoms. Mr. Eros and Mr. Peloso had not previously had interactions with each other. Mr. Peloso indicated that he should be involved in any phone call involving GiveSendGo because Taking Back Our Freedoms had funders who would not agree to fund the Freedom Convoy unless one of their individuals was on the inside for discussions related to fundraising activities. On January 31st, a meeting took place between Mr. Eros, Mr. Wells, Mr. Peloso, Mr. Ballard, and another individual named Jeff Brain, who is the founder of CloutHub. During that meeting, Mr. Ballard described a plan to move the Freedom Convoy off of GoFundMe and onto GiveSendGo. As part of this plan, he also suggested that Freedom Convoy organisers should use CloutHub as their main web presence to advertise their campaign, and indeed, their movement as a whole. Mr. Ballard also described how CloutHub would provide a secure means of communication between organisers of the Freedom Convoy. Mr. Brain, again the founder of CloutHub, also offered to provide Freedom Convoy organisers a quarter-million dollar loan to finance their operations, pending the ability for them to access donated funds. At the end of this meeting, no decision was made with respect to taking CloutHub up on its offer to use its services, or indeed to accept a loan from them. Indeed, Mr. Wells and Mr. Eros, in their interviews with the Commission, found it confusing that CloutHub was involved in these meetings at all. However, as a result of this meeting, Mr. Eros and Mr. Wells did form a connection, and as a result of that connection, an agreement was made to create a crowdfunding campaign on GiveSendGo connected to the Convoy Corporation. That campaign was created and went live on January 31st, again prior to the release of funds the next day from the GoFundMe campaign. Ultimately, when the GoFundMe campaign was shut down, Ms. Lich advertised the fact that the GiveSendGo campaign was in existence, and funders then moved and made donations there. Next slide, please. I mentioned before that payment processors played an important role in the story of the fundraising of the Freedom Convoy. This was a role that was played largely behind the scenes, and it had the most significance when it came to the GiveSendGo campaign. To the public, there was only ever one campaign on GiveSendGo associated with the Freedom Convoy fundraiser. However, for reasons connected with how Stripe operates there were in fact, in effect, two campaigns associated with the Freedom Convoy fundraiser on GiveSendGo. And in order to understand why that came to be, one has to understand a little bit about what payment processors are and how they operate. Most crowdfunding platforms don't actually accept and distribute funds themselves. They are, in effect, kind of a social network shell that provides a platform to attract donors. The actual work of receiving electronic donations and distributing those donations to bank accounts are done by payment processors like Stripe. On the GiveSendGo campaign, in order to set up a campaign at all, one needs to have a Stripe account. However, in order to create a Stripe account, an individual has to have a bank account to associate with it. This presented a unique difficulty for Mr. Eros because, at this point, the Convoy Corporation did not have a bank account. Recall that the Convoy Corporation was only created the day before on January 30th. He therefore could not create a Stripe account, and he therefore could not attach it to the GiveSendGo campaign. As a temporary solution to this problem, Mr. Wells suggested that he use his Stripe account, attach it to the campaign on GiveSendGo, and that is what happened. And so between January 31st when the campaign first went live and February 7th, the GiveSendGo campaign was actually attached to Mr. Wells' Stripe account, and through that, his personal bank account. On February 7th, Mr. Eros did create a Stripe account. However, that account was not connected to the Convoy Corporation directly. By February 7th, the Corporation still did not have a bank account. In order for Mr. Eros to create a Stripe account, he reached an agreement with Keith Wilson to have the Stripe account attached to Mr. Wilson's trust account at his law firm. Once this took place on February 7th, the fundraiser was switched over from Mr. Wells' Stripe account to Mr. Eros' Stripe account. And from February 7th until February 10th or 11th, the evidence on that point is conflicting, donations made to the GiveSendGo campaign went into Mr. Eros' Stripe account. On either February 10th or 11th, the Stripe account was switched back to Mr. Wells' Stripe account and all further donations made to the GiveSendGo campaign went there. Next slide, please. I'll return to the crowdfunding campaigns in a moment, but before I do, a few words about some of the activities involving cryptocurrencies that were taking place. The majority of these activities occurred between January 27th and February 17th of 2022. Next slide. There were a number of cryptocurrency campaigns and fundraisers taking place during the Freedom Convoy. This overview report focuses on three main ones. The first was a cryptocurrency campaign associated with Mr. Garrah's Adopt A Trucker campaign. I'd mentioned before that an individual named Serge created a website for Adopt A Trucker. In addition to soliciting email money transfers, that website also provided information that would allow individuals to donate any of six different types of cryptocurrencies to the Adopt A Trucker campaign. However, it appears that those cryptocurrencies were not in the control of Mr. Garrah directly but were rather controlled by Serge. A second different type of cryptocurrency campaign took place in association with Pat King. This was the Freedom Convoy token campaign, a new cryptocurrency that was created and marketed in association with the Freedom Convoy. The idea behind this campaign was that individuals would exchange pre-existing cryptocurrencies for this new cryptocurrency called Freedom Convoy token. Built into Freedom Convoy token was the process by which four percent of every transaction involving it would be diverted to an entity called the Freedom Convoy Foundation, the idea being that this would provide a long-term source of funds for convoy protesters. However, the Commission was unable to determine whether or not such an entity even exists, and it appears that there is not an active market today for Freedom Convoy token, and therefore, funds are not flowing to any such entity. The most significant cryptocurrency campaign addressed in the overview report was the HonkHonk Hodl campaign. Next slide, please. This campaign was started by an Ottawa area resident named Nicholas St. Louis on or about January 27th. While Mr. St. Louis was the creator of the campaign, there were a number of individuals that were associated with it at different stages, including Benjamin Dichter. Using a cryptocurrency crowdfunding platform called Tallycoin, this campaign ultimately raised approximately 22 bitcoin in donations. The value of those 22 bitcoin at the time was approximately $1.2 million Canadian, although today, the value would be significantly lower. Of that money, approximately 800,000 was distributed to protesters involved in the Ottawa protests. This was done by splitting $800,000 worth of bitcoin into 100 individual electronic wallets and then handing out in sealed envelopes 100 sets of instructions on how to access 1 of those unique online wallets. These were distributed to truckers in Ottawa over a 24-hour period on February 16th and 17th of 2022. Next slide, please. We get to the part of the narrative contained in the overview report that deals with how all of the funds we've just been discussed were eventually blocked from arriving in the hands of fundraisers. In order to understand this, it's useful to understand two types of court orders that were involved in the process that led to these funds being blocked. The first is something called a restraint order. This is a type of order that can only be obtained by the Attorney General of a province or of Canada, and it exists within the Criminal Code's proceeds of crime provisions. In essence, a restraint order is obtained by the Attorney General when they're able to show that there are reasonable grounds to believe that some property meets the definition of offence-related property. Offence-related property is defined to mean any property that is used in any manner in connection with an indictable offence or is intended to be so used. The effect of a restraint order is to prohibit anyone from dealing in any way with the property in question unless in accordance with the terms of the order. The second type of order to understand is called a Mareva injunction. A Mareva injunction is a civil court order. It is ordinarily obtained by plaintiffs in civil proceedings against defendants. It is used to freeze and preserve a defendant's assets and funds where there is a risk that they may be dissipated. Its purpose is to freeze those funds in place, so that if plaintiffs are successful in their lawsuit, there will be assets that they are able to execute judgment against. Both of these types of orders, restraint orders and Mareva injunctions, played a significant role in how funds that were raised were ultimately disposed of. Next slide. On February 10th, the Attorney General of Ontario applied ex parte to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and obtained a restraint order against the funds that had been raised on the GiveSendGo platform, those being the Freedom Convoy campaign, as well as the Adopt-a-Trucker campaign. As a result of the restraint order, Stripe froze the accounts of Mr. Garrah and Mr. Eros. It did not, however, freeze the account of Mr. Wells, as it was held not by Stripe Payment Canada Ltd., but by the American payment company Stripe, which Stripe felt was beyond the reach of the Ontario restraint order. I’ve mentioned before that it is either February 10th or 11th that Mr. Wells changed over the Stripe account associated with the Freedom Convoy fundraiser from Mr. Eros’ frozen strip account to his own active Stripe account. Mr. Wells also took action with respect to the Adopt-a-Trucker campaign. While Mr. Garrah’s stripe account was frozen by the restraint order, Mr. Wells switched that campaign over to a backup payment processor based in the United States called RallyPay. Thus, while both of the fundraising campaigns remained attached to active payment processors and could continue to receive funds, it would be difficult for those funds to arrive in the hands of the organizers. By this point in time, both TD Bank and RBC had been put on notice of the restraint order and they too were prevented, by its terms, from dealing in any way with the funds raised on GiveSendGo. On February 17th, Zexi Li, in her role as the representative Plaintiff of a proposed class action of Ottawa residents, obtained a Mareva injunction. This order applied to a broader set of categories -- assets. It included those assets covered by the restraint order, but also applied to several other individuals and other assets. For example, it applied to assets that were raised by Mr. King and it applied to a range of crypto currencies that were not the subject of the restraint order. On the same day, the Toronto Dominion Bank applied to court to pay in, through an interpleader, approximately $1.4 million that were in the first and second TD accounts in the joint control of Ms. Lich and Mr. Barber. They did so on the basis that the true owners of those funds were unknown and that the funds should be held by the Court until such time as the proper recipients of that money could be determined. The money then stayed in these various bank accounts in various locations, frozen by both the restraint and the Mareva orders. This changed on March 9th, when the Mareva injunction was varied to allowed these funds essentially to be pooled in the hands of an escrow agent, who would hold them all, pending the outcome of the Ottawa litigation. And in the days and weeks that followed, the funds that we have been discussing so far were transferred to the escrow agent, where the Commission understands they remain. Next slide, please. This then takes us, then, to what the Commission understands about the sources of the various funds and their ultimate destinations. Next slide. During the events in question, there were many public statements and questions raised about the issue of foreign versus domestic funding. And in the Order in Council creating this Commission, this issue is also flagged for the Commission’s consideration. As a result of this, the Commission made inquiries with various entities about the sources of funds, both in terms of number of donors and in terms of the value of donations. The result of these inquiries show different patterns for different fundraisers. The simplest are the email money transfer campaigns associated with the Freedom Convoy and Adopt-a-Trucker. Those campaigns were 100 percent Canadian, in that they relied on the email money transfer system that exists within Canada. All donations to those fundraisers originated, at least immediately, from a Canadian domiciled financial institution. The Freedom Convoy GoFundMe campaign was also largely Canadian in its origin. GoFundMe reported that 86 percent of donors were based in Canada, and that by value, 89 percent of donations originated in Canada. The two campaigns on GiveSendGo, however, show a different pattern. Both of those campaigns were largely American based, in terms of where donors were located. Freedom Convoy, 59 percent of donations originated from the United States, 51 percent for Adopt-a-Trucker. However, when measured in terms of the value of donations, the values are slightly different. Fifty-five (55) percent in terms of the actual dollars donated through Adopt-a- Trucker originated in Canada. And in terms of the Freedom Convoy campaign, and equal amount of money originated from Canada and the United States at 47 percent each. The remainder, from other countries around the world. Next slide, please. So we’ll return then to this chart that describes the value of money flowing into and out of a number of different entities. I’ll begin with the GoFundMe campaign. The GoFundMe campaign raised in excess of $10 million Canadian. One million dollars of that was released to Ms. Lich’s Toronto Dominion bank account. However, the full amount was also refunded to donors. In other words, while GoFundMe released a million dollars, it also refunded all donors the full amount of their donations, making up the $1 million shortfall themselves. In addition to the $1 million that was deposited into Ms. Lich’s TD account from the GoFundMe fundraiser, she also received $419,416.63 in email money transfer donations. Out of this approximately $1.4 million put into the first and second TD account, only $26,000 was accessed. The remaining $1,393,000 and change was placed ultimately into escrow as part of the Mareva injunction. With respect to Adopt-a-Trucker, Mr. Garrah raised around $800,000 Canadian on GiveSendGo. Of that amount, approximately $330,000 was released by Stripe into Mr. Garrah’s RBC account. The remaining money contained in Mr. Garrah’s Stripe account was either ultimately paid into escrow, or was the subject of a variety of credit card disputes, charge backs, or fees by various financial institutions. In addition to the $330,000 that Mr. Garrah received into his RBC account, he also received approximately $31,000 in email money transfer donations. Of this amount, approximately $220,000 was released from Mr. Garrah’s RBC account and spent on a variety of things. Approximately $141,000 was paid by RBC from that account into escrow. With respect to the Freedom Convoy campaign on GiveSendGo, it begins to become a little bit difficult to provide precise figures. This is because GiveSendGo was reporting donations in U.S. funds, but that those donations were made over a period of time, subject to a number of different exchange rates. What we can say is that GiveSendGo reported receiving approximately $9.8 million U.S. in donations and that using the February 10th Bank of Canada exchange rate, that would be equal to roughly $12.4M Canadian. Of this, around $3.75M was put into Mr. Eros’ Stripe account and the remaining approximately $8.6M went into Mr. Wells’ Stripe account. The money in Mr. Eros’s Stripe account was sent into escrow; it was not provided to Mr. Eros or into the trust account of Mr. Wilson. There is a bit of a discrepancy there which was explained by Stripe being taken up again by credit card chargebacks and a variety of fees. In terms of Mr. Wells’ Stripe account, while we - - the Commission did not have access to any banking records associated with this, in communications between Mr. Wells and Stripe that the Commission did review, it appears that all donations made and put into his Stripe account were refunded to donors with the exception of certain fees that were subtracted as well as components of those donations that donors had indicated should go directly to GiveSendGo. With respect to the HonkHonk Hodl Campaign, as I mentioned before, out of approximately $1.2M of Bitcoin that was raised, $800,000 of that was distributed to protesters. Paid into escrow was 7.57 Bitcoin which at the time was worth approximately $413,000. Finally, there was a $10,000 bank draft that was also paid into escrow. This money originated from a very brief period of time when the Convoy Corporation did have a bank account at the Steinbach Credit Union. Next slide, please. The overview report contains substantially more detail about these transactions and the events surrounding them. For the parties, the overview report is available in the participant database.

16-032-14,"Thank you, Mr. Mather. My name is Jim Karahalios. I’m counsel for the witness, Mr. Dichter. My last name is spelled k-a-r-a-h-a-l-i-o-s. Thank you, Mr. Commissioner, for giving me a minute in the introduction. Mr. Dichter has a couple of requests. As the Commission had posted on their website, Mr. Dichter made a late application for standing. That was dismissed. In that application, the application for standing was done jointly with Mr. Christopher Garrah who, as we saw in the previous report, was the lead on Adopt a Trucker Campaign. Mr. Garrah has standing as a member of the -- what we are calling “the convoy organizer group”. Mr. Garrah’s in attendance here today. We received yesterday the time allocations today with regards to after the evidence in-chief is provided. It provides for 15 minutes for the convoy organizers and five minutes for, I believe, the Democracy Fund, the JCCF, and 10 minutes for Mr. Dichter’s counsel. Given that the convoy organizers and the JCCF Democracy Fund have very similar interests, Mr. Dichter would like to ask the Commissioner, with the approval of Mr. Garrah who’s a member of, jointly, the convoy organizers in standing, and gives his approval, to consider -- and I hope my friend from the convoy organizers would agree to reallocate some of the 15 minutes provided to the convoy organizers to Mr. Dichter’s counsel at the end for further questions.",16-032-15,32,15,14,speaker_start,STATEMENT BY MR.

At the end of Mr. Mather’s evidence in-chief, if you could just give Mr. Dichter a little bit of time to decide whether he want that Rule 59 Application to be brought forward to you for more time in evidence in-chief by me, that would be appreciated.",16-034-08,34,8,6,speaker_start,STATEMENT BY MR.

16-048-16,"So on February 4th somebody came into my room and said, “The lawyers just did a video that’s the complete opposite of our messaging.” We call it the War of the Worlds video now. And I looked at it and I was horrified. It was “Come to Ottawa; your freedoms are dying. Canada is dying.” Like doom and gloom, not peace, love, unity, and freedom which built the movement. So I went over to the ARC Hotel to explain my sentiments and maybe a little aggressively, but you know, there were so many problems going on at that time, it was just another wrench that was thrown into the spokes of the wheel. And so I went back after a 20- or 30-minute long meeting about a few issues, a number of issues which I’m sure we’ll get into. I was presented with the class action suit and a retainer. “Here, we’re going to give you free legal advice if you guys sign it.” Soi that was the nature of the meeting. And I went back to the Sheridan and I realize I left my laptop. I was so heated I didn’t even pull it out. So I went back and I slipped, the first time I was going back and forth. And finally, in a panic, going to get my computer -- my laptop which is my life -- I slipped on this massive thing of ice in front of the EDC Building and I slipped on the ice. And I remember the exact moment. I still picture it. It was nine o'clock, 9:30 at night on the 4th approximately, and there were a couple of trucks in the parking lane, a bunch of cars; the driving lanes were completely open. A couple of cars were parked in front of the Sheridan dropping people off. And it was silent. There was no one around. And that’s when people were honking, and it was dead silent. I felt very alone and secluded. It was weird. So I tried to get up. I heard a crack. I’ve never broken anything but I'm wiggling my toes and I’m like, “It’s not broken.” But I couldn’t get up. And I hear from the distance, in front of the ARC Hotel, a trucker, a red suit, a big beard, says, “You need help?” And I'm like, “I think so.” So he comes over and he says, “You need help?” I’m like, “Yeah. And he puts his hand on my ankle and he says, “Jesus, Lord, God bless this ankle. Heal it now, thy Father.” And I was, “I love you, man, but I just need a paramedic.” And other guys were like, “Do you need help?” I’m like, “Yeah, this time send a medic, please.” And it was amazing, because there was -- you know, in just an hour, there was so much friction, but -- and this was a common thing. There was friction and then we'd get together, friction, we get -- so we were able to work out our differences when we needed to. They carried me onto the -- into the ARC Hotel lobby. They put me on the couch. They called the paramedics. And everybody just -- it was a serious moment. Everybody came back to help me. Chad was by my side. Miranda was pumping me with drugs. I don't know what she's giving me. Brigitte was there. The doctors came down to look at me, to say that that is broken. So it was amazing -- and then the paramedics got there in, I don't know, 30 minutes, 45 minutes. And they said, ""Yeah, it's broken. You need to go to the hospital."" So I said, ""Okay, should I call an ambulance?"" They said, ""Well, the problem is, you're not an important case. You're just a broken ankle. There's other people that have more serious cases. If you can call one, it might take about an hour or so."" So I asked the -- our volunteers, and they said, ""Yeah, we can -- one of us can drive you to the hospital."" And Ottawa General, I'm telling -- Ottawa Hospital, 20 minutes from the hotel to having a doctor cutting up my new jeans. It was crazy.

It's mood and behaviour. The mood and behaviour was positive until right now. You just undid all of that. And he seemed concerned. And he said, ""Oh, oh, I'm sorry."" Well, and you should have thought of that before. Anyways, that was it. And then the next thing was, ""Well, you've just been served, congratulation, with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.""

The trucks are parked, so I don't know what you want to do. You want to move trucks. That was a little suspect to me in the back of my head, but I just kind of left it there. And then the next morning, somebody comes to my hotel to tell me, ""Tom Marazzo, guess what he's doing?"" I'm, like, ""What?"" ""A press conference.""

I didn't see these residential streets, and I'm sure people will tell -- give me some, you know, anecdotes of a street here and there that might have had a truck on it. Okay, that might be the case, but that was not my experience. I just -- the whole idea of let's consolidate everything into Wellington, the cops told us where to park. Chris Garrah was here for a week. He got maps from the Ottawa Police saying ""Park your trucks here"" because we wanted to have safety routes so safety vehicles could get through during the protests, emergency vehicles, and people could just generally drive around.

We hope that our parliamentarians and our media tone down the rhetoric."" She was really stressed. So Tamara was coming in infrequently, different days, two, three times, sometimes once a day, sometimes not at all. She would disappear. And it's because she was under tremendous amount of stress, not only this class action suit that we were all given, we didn't know what to do, everybody was scared, and we were being told we had to behave in a certain way or else we're going to lose our free legal advice, but at the same time, every three seconds she was getting hounded with another problem here, another problem there. And I did communicate to her, and I said, ""Tamara, we need to get you a handler."" And she didn't want to. She wanted to deal with people directly, which I get, that's her strength, she really communicates well with people. But she -- I mean, you know what decision fatigue is? She had decision fatigue by early morning. She was just burnt out because there was so many demands being put on her. I put a little bit of a moat around me. I had the three people in the COMS team working with me, and I said, ""Everything send it to us, and we'll filter it; otherwise, we won't be able to deal with a million problems all at once."" But her management structure or system is different than mine, I guess. And just to further that. So she would come into my room to give her a hug, and to relax and calm down, the world's not falling, everything's going to work. The government's not evil.

I had no idea who half of those people were, but they were leading different convoys from around the country. They're amazing people from all over, different cultures of Canada. So it's not a group of two or three people, there were hundreds of people, and then there were all these other little groups as well. It was a very, you know, the parallels to bitcoin, very decentralised. And -- but I think we had the greatest, what I mentioned before, position of moral persuasion that we could help influence people more, but that's not a guarantee. And that actually came up on the 18th when the road captains came into my hotel after a trucker had guns drawn at him, they smashed his windows, the police pulled guns on him, arrested him in the snow. Tamara had been arrested, Chris had been arrested. The road captains came into my room. There seemed to be, I don't know if a lack of leadership but maybe a lack of decision-making, or they needed just another head to bounce ideas off of. And they told me the story, and I said, ""Okay. Well, I'll support what you guys want to do, but if you're asking me if the police are getting violent maybe it's time to leave."" And to my surprise, the first person to pipe up was Brigitte, and she said, ""We can't let people get hurt. We need to leave."" And then Joe did the same thing and all the other road captains that were sitting on my bed, and standing up, and Johnny and everybody said, “Yeah.” And I said, “Okay. Call your Police Liaison Officers right now. Don’t argue. Just tell them we’re going to leave, we’re going to go, we’re going to communicate the message to everybody that we’re going to leave.” And then I went on to social media and I did echo that sentiment in a Twitter message. I probably should have done a thread to clarify it better, but little bit of a panic. And then Keith Wilson called me and said, “You need to leave.” I said, “Well I need to -- I’m in a wheelchair with a broken ankle. What do you think -- going to bust down the doors of the hotel and arrest me?” And he said they just might. I’m like, “Keith, don’t be so dramatic. That’s not -- I’m not on the street.” But he argued with me for 20 minutes and he convinced me, he said to me, I’ll always remember, he said, “Somebody needs to be able to speak up for freedom and if you get arrested too and end up getting subject to a gag order, then you can’t speak.” I thought, like, all right. And so I had a friend in Ottawa and I called an Uber, I got out of the hotel, the red zone, which is what the police wanted to clear out, and I went to stay with my friend until I could get my cast off.",16-063-25,63,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

16-078-01,"Okay. Mr. Wilson has both given testimony and also had an interview with the Commission. And in his interview, Mr. Wilson stated that you were, at least to his understanding, aware that an agreement had been reached with the mayor -- between the mayor and Tamara, and he expressed some surprise that you sent your tweet and Tamara’s retweet. And specifically, Mr. Wilson has identified this -- the following document as evidencing that knowledge, HRF1491 -- HRF00001491. So we’ll scroll down. You'll see that this is February 12th at 3:47 in the afternoon. Mr. Wilson writes to you. The middle paragraph says: “Hence the drafting committee will keep working on the broader document for review by the Board tomorrow but in the meantime below is a draft communication for the captains/truckers specific to the mayor’s arrangements to allow you to advance into Wellington and Elgin while at the same time taking away the excuse that Trudeau wants to unleash the police goons and seize trucks. Remember, we are trying to block Trudeau from having the justification to cause the police to use the new emergency power against the truckers and to allow the truckers to stay here in Ottawa for as long as it takes, et cetera.” And then if you scroll up, sorry, to the top you then replied shortly afterwards, saying: “Looks good to me.” What did you understand Mr. Wilson to be talking about in his email when you responded, “Looks good to me”?",16-078-03,78,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

16-080-10,"Yeah. Well, there was one caveat which I started to -- you know, people say things and you put the red flag up in the back of your head. So with the class action suit there were the injunctions, motions put forward and whatever. Okay, we already signed off with him and the JCCF; turns out our retainer was with the JCCF. They were going to -- okay, fine. And he came back and he said to me, to all of us individually. But I remember him saying to me, “Okay, so I have good news. We’ve got a number of items that the class action suit wanted, the people on the -- the complainants wanted. And they’ve all been rejected with one exception. The one exception is the horn honking has to be limited in scope and to one designated area.” And I said to him, “Who cares about the horn honking? That’s not what we’re here for. We’re here for mandates, whatever.” And that’s how he communicated it to me. And that was it. So then, what I didn’t tell him is I took that document and I sent it to a friend of mine who is a legal researcher at a firm. And I said, “This is what I was told this document says. I don’t read legalese. Can you just interpret it because he’s saying that the media is lying that we actually won. What is your interpretation?” And she said to me, “I don't know who’s telling you you won. They wanted the horns stopped or whatever that was, the part of the injunction. And they won. So whoever is telling you you won is not being honest with you.” And I thought, is he just overselling it because he’s trying to be compassionate and he knows we’re under a lot of stress? Or was it just dishonest? I don’t know. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt at that time; maybe he’s just trying to be supportive in some sort of way.",16-080-12,80,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. JOHN MATHER,MR.

We addressed that it deals with all of our mandates and it’s a document that we’re presenting to the government to try to communicate. And we want to negotiate and sit down and say, “Hey, you've created and committed crimes against us by unlawfully enacting these unlawful mandates. So we would like to sit down as a group.” And the MOU actually addresses all of that. It always did, from Day 1 because two truckers sat down and wrote it.

I didn’t know -- I guess at this point I was kind of questioning the validity of anything I saw, really. And it was definitely alarming.

16-353-01,"Well, as I said, we were on the way to meet with Mr. Peckford when we heard that Mr. Trudeau was going to be invoking the Act, or announcing that he was going to be invoking the Act later that day. And Mr. Peckford thought it would be a good idea for us to do a press conference about it also. So we did do a press conference later that day, prior to the Prime Minister’s press conference. And we wanted to continue and peacefully protest. But I knew that people were leaving, which I encouraged. And I believe it was the 16th; it was the day before I was arrested that some of the road captains and friends that were close to our organization started leaving which of course I encouraged. I mean, I was concerned about what could be coming. We had heard that there was quite a police presence coming and obviously I didn’t want to see anyone be hurt.

16-353-25,"Well, it was, again, kind of ironic because I went down to the War Memorial that day to attend the service that the vets were having there every day. I spent my afternoon walking the streets with a veteran and my husband and Miranda, one of the road captains, just talking to people. And I was aware the night before -- I'm sure you've saw the video -- that it was most likely coming or that there was a chance that I could be arrested. And we went back to the hotel and within 15 minutes, everybody's phones started blowing up and that Mr. Barber had been arrested. Mr. Bulford and I were at the Swiss Hotel with Mr. Scubic and Mr. Tiessen and we discussed what we should do, what our next steps should be. And we were concerned that if they were starting to arrest the organizers, that they would come to the hotel. And my husband was there, and Mr. Bulford's wife was there. And obviously, that was the last thing that I would ever want my husband to see, was to me be arrested. We definitely didn’t want that sort of activity occurring at the hotel with a woman who had been so kind to us, actually, who was about to lose her business until we showed up. But like I said in my video, I wasn’t afraid. I believe and still believe that we did an excellent job remaining peaceful, advocating for the police, advocating for respecting the police, and so we made the conscious decision to go out and ask the police if they were looking for us. We walked up to the Hill and I believe it was Metcalfe, and we stopped and talked to some officers. I'm not sure what their rank was. There was two Suburbans pointed with their headlights up at the Hill. And we walked up to them and Mr. Bulford identified who we were and asked the gentlemen if we heard that they were looking for organizers. We are the -- we're part of the volunteers, and he indicated to us that he didn’t have information on that. Danny asked him maybe a second time, or he asked him another question, and he rolled his window up, communicated with somebody, rolled his window down, and said, ""No."" And I remember saying, ""Well, if that changes, we're just going to be up at the Hill here."" And we went up to the Hill and I think we were there for an hour and a half to two hours, and we decided to go back to our room. We had presented ourself to the police. They indicated that we were not -- they were not looking for us. We walked down to the ARC Hotel and warmed up. It was cold that night. And I believe Sean was staying there. I needed to get something, so we warmed up in there for about 10 minutes, and then started heading back to the Swiss Hotel. As we crossed the street, there had been -- there was construction on my left side of the street in front of the buildings, I remember, so it wasn’t very well lit. And as we were walking, I met another couple coming towards us, and the lady hugged me and thanked me and Danny and she was crying. And we were standing there talking to this couple and all of a sudden, three Suburbans just went -- police Suburbans -- I think that’s what they are -- went flying down the street past us, and then a fourth one came and pulled over. And so at that point, I was pretty sure that I was about to be arrested.",16-353-27,353,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. JOHN MATHER (cont'd),MS. TAMARA LICH,tamara lich

I've lost my freedom to communicate with my friends, which was quite traumatizing because we just experienced something huge, and we didn’t get any time to even sit down as a group and just talk about it and talk about our experience. We didn’t have that opportunity. That was taken away from me. I have to be very careful about every move that I make. As you know, I was arrested on an alleged breach charge for attending a dinner in Toronto. I had the police show up at the place that I'm staying last weekend because somebody saw me outside smoking a cigarette.

16-356-16,"I have yet to see the particulars of the mischief that I am alleged to have committed. I just -- it's definitely affected my life. It's something that I have never been arrested before. I -- the process, the legal process, I find extremely frustrating. My trial's not til next year. I have to live under these conditions for a year. But I will -- I'll make it work. I'll manage. And I did everything I felt that I could do in my power through the lives that I was doing, and I believe it worked, as I was advocating again for peaceful protest, respect the police, please respect other people. That was a big part of the reason I did that live the last night. I saw a lot of those flags, and while I support anyone's freedom of speech, it's not something that resonated with me. I saw and heard of people that were upset with some mainstream media, and I just wanted to -- I did my video because regardless of how angry we are with the lack or the leadership that we've seen, the divisive rhetoric, the division between the vaccinated and unvaccinated that I've seen come from elected officials, civil servants towards their own people. And I saw those flags one day, and I kept thinking, I got to get to the stage and make a speech. Like, I felt that I needed to get there and I needed to just say, you know, Mr. Trudeau has three children, and I have three children. And my kids have to wake up and see the stuff on social media too. Actually, when I was arrested, my 19-year-old daughter woke up to read an article that I hung myself in jail.

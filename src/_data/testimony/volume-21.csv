As many of you know, we had to interrupt the hearing yesterday because our senior counsel, Gabriel Poliquin, suddenly became indisposed. He was seen by medical professionals and his episode was likely nothing serious. So he’s expected to make a quick recovery after a few days of recuperation and will be back with the Commission next week. He wishes to thank all who have reached out to him with messages of support, and it’s very appreciated by him, and, of course, by the Commission.

21-011-07,"Certainly. And very briefly, you have, of course, multiple levels of policing. The RCMP is the federal policing entity in the province, as it is anywhere in Canada. Within Alberta, we have a Police Act, which constitute -- which dictates the levels of responsibility for policing being for communities over the threshold of 5,000, they're required to have their own police force or a municipal service.

In their -- their role insofar as the border dispute at Coutts was directly in support of the RCMP's operational response, and we provided a number of our officers to the RCMP to assist in any number of areas, including traffic control and checkpoint control, under their direction and within their operations. Ordinarily, the sheriffs work collaboratively and cooperatively with the RCMP, but independently from the RCMP as a peace officer organization. They are not police officers. They have a specific mandate and specific authorities, which are quite broad.

21-014-01,"Certainly. The event at the border specifically was obviously a policing event, and police are charged with the responsibility for administering -- or for overseeing and addressing public order events and cases of, you know, breaches of the law, et cetera. In that particular case, the police force of jurisdiction being the RCMP has overall command and control of the event, and it would be improper and problematic for an independent agency such as the sheriffs to operate in an operational manner in that, or an unfortunate matter in that event, outside of the command and control of the RCMP as you could conceivably come across purposes for some of the strategies that were attempting to be embarked upon, both from a negotiation perspective or an enforcement perspective, et cetera.

And there was a lot of challenge in trying to extend not only hours of operation but also accommodate, at alternate points of contact for Customs clearance, the different types of commercial goods that travel through that border point.

21-032-25,"So as a public official, we of course provide advice to elected officials. Within that, we explored the realm of the possible, in the sense that we did identify the Emergency Act, its provisions, and the authorities that would come with its invocation. We also identified a number of statutes that provided law enforcement with effective arrests and charging tools, to deal with the actions that were taking place at Coutts. And to be fair, there are a number of authorities that exist sub or below the Emergency Act that would allow for police to arrest, detain, and remove people from that area. The determination was made by our government that, given the number of tools that were already available in statute to police, the addition of the Emergency Act would’ve changed nothing in terms of the authorities that the police required. And you mentioned compelling individuals to cooperate, that would certainly be something that could be attempted, but there’s also information that many of the individuals within the industry were fairly supportive of the protest or did not wish to be seen to be involved in taking action against the protest, for their own reasons, and I won’t speak to those ‘cause I don’t want to put myself in their head. But the reality is that a compulsion to somebody to provide support could conceivably, and probably, have been met just as easily with a refusal and then you are left with a choice of having to now deal with enforcement in relation to service providers and still not be any further ahead, in terms of where you’re trying to go. We ultimately thought there were more appropriate and better avenues to seek that support.

21-046-27,"To begin with, the RCMP, as the police force of jurisdiction, made their efforts and they had some limited success very early on, very, very, very early on, first days, that that support dissolved from industry quite quickly. They went afield -- and that was local support. They went afield and garnered some limited support which also quite quickly dissolved. And then they were struggling after that to find any support anywhere, both within the province and commercially outside of the province, B.C., Saskatchewan. I believe they might even have looked to commercial entities in the south, but I'm not a hundred percent certain of that. I'll let them speak to that. They approached us to indicate the challenges they were facing, and they indicated that they were going through their channels to seek support from the Canadian government for the use of heavy lift capacity that exists at the Canadian Forces Base in Edmonton, and were looking for anything that we could do to assist in terms of just generally trying to work through that. We initially, when tasked with trying to support them, supported their call for Canadian Forces logistical support, and we also embarked on a process, sort of an evolving process of attempting to secure that lift capacity for them. The first was through revisiting the commercial entities that they contacted as the government to try and secure support for them. We were unable to gain any support that way. We looked afield to the City of Edmonton, City of Lethbridge, City of Calgary, industry, ATCO, those sorts of things, CNCP, colleagues to the south of the U.S. border, to try and look for any capacity that we could get there. We had some very limited success, in the sense that we had one city that was able to provide us with a heavy tow truck. And that’s a minor -- sort of like a loader type, and small crane support from another city. But not the equipment that the RCMP required. So in support of our ask to the Canadian Forces, we had the RMCP actually set out exactly what they needed for equipment, should they have to go to that type of enforcement action. And that was what constituted sort of our list of two trucks and capacity that we sought out for them. Eventually, we determined that there was not going to be a commercial avenue there, and it was becoming apparent that we weren’t going to get access to the tow capacity of CFB Edmonton. And we were able to, through a multiple number of sort of, you know, online sites, identify five vendors who had lift capacity, used two trucks, if you will, for sale. The commercial providers of those entities, it was a long waiting list to get anything from the actual manufacturers. We’d explored that already. We did manage to secure a small number on the weekend of I think it would have been the 12th. We had them in place down in Lethbridge and turned over to the RCMP, and by the 14th, had identified and were closing the deal on the remainder of the list, save two items, which were all, I believe, in place on the 15th, in the south, for the RCMP at their disposal.",21-046-29,46,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

I thought that the Federal Government did have a role. At the end of the day, these protestors were in Ottawa to protest, mainly, the imposition of a vaccine mandate on January 15 on international truckers. They were on Parliament’s doorstep. They were in the National Capital Region. The Federal Government, Public Safety Canada does have a Memorandum of Understanding with Ottawa Police Service with regards to the provision of policing resources in and around Capital Hill. The OPP is not a signatory to that MOU. So from my perspective, the Federal Government did have a role to play, just like Ontario had a role to play in the provision of resources. And so I made that known to Jody Thomas. I felt that some of the options that were available to the Federal Government included a possibility of meeting with and listening to the protestors, the possibility of amending their vaccine mandate, the possibility of providing additional resources to the Ottawa Police Service.

21-225-04,"So with regards to the -- I'm sorry, we were receiving additional information from Commissioner Carrique with regards to what additional powers he required. So when you look at B, for example, there was a concern that if a vehicle was seized, sent to the pound, a person could certainly pay the fine or the storage fee, get the car back, and then certainly join up again with the protest. So this particular emergency order gave the police the ability to store that vehicle for as long as the emergency order was in effect. Also, there was the issue, as articulated by ADM Freeman yesterday with regards to CVORs and ensuring that the police made reasonable efforts to notify those individuals that had CVORs and where the vehicles were being detained and stored. There was also the requirement to ensure that tow truck operators' storage yards were, effectively, compensated, and so there was a provision here that referenced the Storage Liens Act, I believe it was, that made it clear that any monies owing could be enforced through that particular Act.",21-225-06,225,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

The Board could not infringe on operations, could not direct the Chief on operations, but it certainly had the ability to make those recommendations. Had the Chief declined to accept those recommendations, that would have informed the Board as to what its next steps ought to have been.

Options available at the municipal level included increasing maximum fine for bylaw offences. Now, I know that they requested the regional senior judge increase the out-of-court settlements. That was done -- great -- but certainly not the maximum offences permitted. They could have done that. They could have permitted -- they could have issued an order preventing all sorts of activities. They could have leveraged Section 444 of the Municipal Act. They could have issued orders to stay out of a certain area. They could have issued an order prohibiting all sorts of activities within a defined area. So there were all sorts of tools that could have been provided by the municipality. Whether or not those additional authorities could have been enforced by the police service of the jurisdiction was up to the discretion of local police. And we’ve heard Chief Sloly talk about some of the impediments and challenges about enforcement and that they would be swarmed, that there was an aggressiveness to the protesters, but I think that equipping police in the earlier stages additional tools could have potentially been helpful.",21-253-10,253,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

I reference the Caledonia issue, and that took several weeks to resolve, three to four weeks. And so, from my perspective, the operation in Ottawa to dismantle the blockade from a policing perspective was in fact a success. Let’s not forget, there was no loss of life. Nobody got hurt. Tear gas was not used. We did not have those ugly scenes of people with bloodied heads. And so from that perspective, the police operation to dismantle was a success.

If not, the Chair asked what legal authorities, what resources from the board or what assistance the board can provide at this time.""

He did comment that there is nothing in the definition of adequate and effective policing that could resolve a city under siege, a threatened democracy, a nation-wide insurrection. He further commented that a police service is not created/contemplated to deal with a city under siege and as such, there is not necessarily a concrete plan for such a scenario as described.""

21-385-22,"Thank you, Commissioner. My name is Darrell Kloeze. I’m counsel for the Province of Ontario. Good evening, Mr. Di Tommaso. I only have a few questions for you, and honestly these are just for purpose of clarifying the record, given that we’re not a party to this proceeding and we will not be attending at the evidence of the Federal Representatives. The one point I wanted to raise, Mr. Di Tommaso, you were asked questions, both by Commission Counsel and by counsel for Canada, about the tripartite meetings taken at the Ministers level. So these were the meetings that the Solicitor General was invited to. And I think Commission Counsel did put it to you that, at some point, there were calls between Federal Minister Mendocino and the Premier, and the Premier had expressed that he would send the Solicitor General to these meetings, but then later said that he would not send the Solicitor General.

We don't need to bring it up, but I just want to put on the record the second document reference that wasn't put to you by Counsel for Canada, and if we can put that up, SSM.NSC.CAN.00001148. And obviously, Deputy, you weren't at any of these meetings -- you weren't on any of these calls, so you won't have any knowledge about them. I just wanted to put that document up so we can see. And if we can just scroll down a bit, Mike Jones, I understand, is the Chief of Staff for Minister Mendocino. On Wednesday, February 9th in the afternoon, the first paragraph, ""My boss spoke with Premier Ford just before today's avail."" I understand that to mean press availability. ""My boss said [he] needed the province at the table on policing efforts and that the current blockades are harming the economy and costing jobs. Ford responded that he understood."" And if we go down to the second paragraph, ""Immediately following the media avail, Ford called my boss again to say that he wouldn't be sending Minister Jones to the tripartite conversations...""

21-391-03,"Okay. If you have the strength, there's just a couple of questions I'd like to ask you. As you know, I'm -- this Commission is concerned with the Declaration of the Emergency and but also can make recommendations on the Emergency Act and presumably dealing with public order emergencies. And I guess I'm interested in views you may have as to knowing as you do what happened in Ottawa, what happened in Windsor, whether you might have some comments or suggestions, and in particular, on how or whether there should be more coordination on -- in areas where there is clear overlap, such as border crossings, where the impact, if you like, is much broader than Ontario, it's a federal, or Ottawa where, as we know, the impact certainly was greater on the federal government than the Parliamentary Precinct. And leaving aside whether it was properly declared an emergency, which is something I have to deal with, are there things in -- do you view aspects of coordination in particular or other aspects of the Act that might be reviewed?",21-391-04,391,4,3,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. DARRELL KLOEZE,COMMISSIONER ROULEAU,commissioner rouleau
21-391-22,"Certainly. I think there is an opportunity for greater coordination amongst governments and police services and intelligence agencies. I think Chief Sloly referred to that very thing, especially in regards to intelligence sharing. And I would certainly endorse that suggestion, recommendation by Chief Sloly. I've also had the opportunity to briefly review the recommendations made by Commissioner Carrique, and I certainly support and endorse those recommendations that he's made. Over and above that, I would also suggest, this is my own personal opinion, that a task force of some type be put together to study the issue of the right to protest. And it's enshrined in the Constitution, but what are the limits, because my understanding is that people have an understanding that protests can occur at any time, in any location, for any length of time. So are there reasonable limits that ought to be imposed? I don't know what the answer to that is. That's something that this Commission could certainly suggest that that matter be studied in regards to lawful protest. There are limits that can be prescribed. I'm not in a position to determine what those limits ought to be. But certainly, I think that the public needs to be reminded that when you exercise your rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that you also have responsibility to your fellow citizens as well, and that those rights are certainly not absolute.

21-392-20,"Okay. If I could push you a little bit on the -- an aspect that I'm interested in, which is the coordination, and we've heard about the coordination in Windsor that was very effective, police, and messaging from the City, from all of the parties. And that messaging -- or the coordination in Ottawa does not seem to have been as fluid at the police level. I think we’ve heard evidence about that, nor at the political level. And I think we’ve heard about that. Is there something -- should there be a process or a protocol for such events that involve the different orders of government in such events? A protocol, or a best practices, or something?",21-392-21,392,21,20,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. DARRELL KLOEZE,COMMISSIONER ROULEAU,commissioner rouleau
21-393-04,"That’s certainly something that this Commission could make recommendations on. I think there is opportunity, there are opportunities for greater collaboration. I think one of the key differences between the police operations in Windsor in comparison to Ottawa was that the OPP provided key leadership in terms of command and control. They made it clear to the Ottawa -- I’m sorry, to the Windsor Police Service, that they were in charge. There was a very rapidly developed, unified command. Very rapidly. And the scope and scale of the Windsor blockade was certainly much smaller, but it was that coordination where Windsor Police Service accepted unified command and the lead by the OPP very quickly. I think that was a critical point for Windsor to have done that resulted in the dismantling of the blockade that much more quickly.",21-393-05,393,5,4,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

Is there room for, or should there be room for coordination between Emergency Acts, because we hear about what Ontario’s Emergency Act can do, what the federal could do, what triggers one, what doesn’t trigger the other, and obviously in this case, the Emergency Act of Canada, I guess, is 40 years old, or 30 some years old.

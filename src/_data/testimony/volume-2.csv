02-008-06,"Bonjour. Good morning. Welcome, to Day 2. Bienvenue à la deuxième journée, and our first day of live witnesses. Before I call on the witnesses, there are just a couple of matters I want to raise. The first is the -- what the public and the media know, in particular, with respect to exhibits. I may have mislead people yesterday in calling Exhibits 1, 2, and 3. As the parties know, the documents that become exhibits are put into the database that's available to the public in accordance with their unique document number, not as exhibits. And it's important to know that all the exhibits that go into the database that's available for the public, all the documents are not necessarily referred to in the hearing, in the sense that there are many documents that will become part of the record, either because they were referred to in the overview reports you heard yesterday, so that not only the overview report goes into the record but all of the documentation that supports that. Same thing for other types of reports or affidavits or witness statements, when they go into evidence, we -- what we have arranged, if you like, is that all the backup goes in so that the full record will be composed not only of documents referred to here, but documents referred to in the backup documentation. So a little bit complicated, but it's simply to alert the media and the public that when you go to the website of the Commission, you'll find a lot more documents that back up the statements and the evidence. The parties know this because the parties have been provided these documents, have reviewed them, and they may question witnesses about them, but it's a much more fulsome record. Because of the timelines we have, we couldn't spent days noting documents and putting in all of that evidence. The contentious evidence you will hear at the hearing. Don't worry about that, the parties will ensure that. La deuxième chose que j’aimerais soulever, c'est qu’il n’est pas permis d’enregistrer ou de diffuser de vos téléphones, et cetera, en salle. There is no livestreaming allowed or a recording of the proceedings. It is livestreamed by the Commission, but people should not be doing this from their own phones. So with that brief introduction, there are -- this, according to the schedule, will be a busy day. It -- if it goes according to plan, we will not finish before seven o'clock tonight, so let's get started as soon as possible because we have scheduled a full day. It can be shorter if people shorten their cross-examinations, and we'll -- but obviously the times have been allocated and we'll hold people to it. So Commission Counsel, ready to go.

02-012-10,"The long-term effects are loss of hearing, loss of balance, some vertigo triggered by the sound of any horn now, triggered by certain music as the music was very loud, and a physical trigger when I get a smell of gas.

02-012-19,"Certainly, I attribute it to the very, very loud and constant noise from the horns, from the music, from the idling trucks. Even when the horns abated for a minute or two, the trucks idled. The trucks idled all night. And so it just was an assault on my hearing. And I can certainly tell now that there is a diminished function. I was able before to listen to media, for example, at a normal level of, say, four. Now I have to turn it to six.",02-012-21,12,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS. VICTORIA De La RONDE,victoria de la ronde

02-013-06,"Well, certainly as I mentioned, it was such an experience of helplessness, especially during the event, where the horn blowing was so loud, and continuous. There was absolutely no place for me to go in my own unit, there was no place that had any less sound. I checked different rooms to see, well, maybe I can sleep on the floor here. There was no place that had a diminished sound. And if there was, it wasn't a space, like, a closet that was big enough to sleep in. There was just no escape to that. So I felt trapped and helpless during that. During the fireworks when the debris from the fireworks sprayed against my windows, I was just terrified that they would break any minute because I thought how could I do something, and what could I do at midnight, and who could come at midnight? And this is February. A broken window would have been pretty disastrous. So there was a lot of anxiety and discomfort.",02-013-08,13,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

02-014-07,"During the time of the occupation - - I struggle to call it a protest because I know what a protest is, but it was incredibly difficult to get anything done because of the noise. There was a significant impact on things like focus and, you know, just even living day to day. Sleep deprivation was one of the first things that affected me personally and it also affected the animals that I live with as well. They seemed quite distressed. But for me personally, it was almost impossible to get a good night's sleep or a full night's sleep, if any, and if anything, it would be low quality and often interrupted by a sudden loud horn. And when it was quiet -- because there were brief periods where it was quiet, I was riddled with the anxiety that the horns were going to start again, and when the horns started again, it was left -- we were left wondering, you know, when they would stop, if they would ever stop again. And, yeah, it was just day-to-day living within my own home, living in fear of the sound and the intrusion really that they posed just being outside on our streets. Yeah, and further to that, it was unpleasant, to say the least, to exit my home, but it was something I did anyways as I didn't feel like it was -- the whole situation was wrong, and I felt almost a little bit of defiance, wanting to go outside and continue to live my life as best I could. And when I did, oftentimes, I was harassed for wearing a mask or being -- I was told to smile more under my mask, or, you know, just these kinds of comments that wouldn't have otherwise occurred and on a quiet, normal walk day-by-day. And I think what was one of the worst things was whenever you chose -- well, whenever I chose not to engage with the individuals that were occupying my neighbourhood, they would blast their horns at me with a smile on their faces, and then they would cheer in unison and almost take joy in the -- in my flinching, at my recoiling from the noise that I had been essentially experiencing non-stop for the entire duration of the events that occurred.",02-014-09,14,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

02-015-22,"Yes. I work very hard to be independent and safe as a person with a disability. That objective is very important to me and every success in reaching that objective is coveted. So that was gone. I was trained to walk with the traffic, to walk with the flow, to negotiate and keep myself safe on the street. Of course, there was no traffic or no flow, no indicator, or if it's idling, I wasn't sure if these big vehicles overhanging a small sidewalk, if they decided to suddenly shift or change, if they could see me, so it was terrifying. The sound was so high that I could not hear any chimes or signals that we use at the ends of the street to tell us that it's safe to cross. That was just not available, so it was -- it just was not safe in my world. Also, in terms of independence, I do everything myself. I order my groceries. I order prescriptions. And but -- and I take public transportation or private transportation to go to meetings, to go to appointments, to do my daily business. So I had everything set up for myself as an independent person, living alone in downtown Ottawa, which provided such good services. But immediately, immediately, there was no taxi, no Uber, no Para Transpo, no grocery delivery, which I depended on, no taxi even to go and get some, no prescription delivery. Some way had to be figured out how to obtain all the necessities of life. The restrictions on my ability to get food was gone -- or was there, I -- so that was the impact in terms of my mobility, so I found myself trapped.",02-015-24,15,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

02-017-06,"There was absolutely no ability to negotiate my environment by using sound.

02-017-15,"Well it was the middle of winter, so really the first thing you noticed when you stepped outside was all of the snow, because services were unable to be rendered due to the occupation that was going on. And further to that, the snow was often coloured yellow or brown due to the public urination and defecation that took place gratuitously, often alongside of my building and just, quite literally, anywhere you walked, on every corner. And on these intersections, often times there were illegal bonfires and yeah, just trash burning right next to, you know, cans of fuel or near the same areas where these individuals would later set off fireworks. And I just remember feeling like it was such a surreal sight. It almost felt like you were in something like the purge because it -- although I didn’t often see direct acts of violence, it was -- there was a certain chaos on the streets and that feeling of chaos and rule breaking and law breaking gradually increased as things progressed. Yeah. Just I need a moment. Just sort of on my daily walks, you know, going to the gym, getting groceries, running errands, we often -- I often encountered individuals that were associated with the occupation and being -- you know, I’m a small Asian woman. I wore a mask most of the time due to the situation that was going on. It was -- like I said, it made you a target because it signaled to the people on our streets that we were not supportive of their cause and that we were not one of them. And in turn, as I mentioned before, they would increase their honking, and target their honking, and shout at us, shout at me, about how they were doing things for us and that they were fighting for our freedoms when, at the same time, I was unable to walk the streets feeling safe, really, because it wasn’t -- I didn’t feel safe. You know, my guard was up all the time and you had to watch every detail so carefully because these people would just approach me out of nowhere. And you didn’t -- you really didn’t know what they were going to do to you, and especially after I took action as an individual, it became different being a person walking on the streets. But I was never deterred from going outside. There was one -- only one moment where I was very, very afraid after my identity and name had been made public. And I had really covered myself up completely so that I was completely unrecognizable, to the point where my neighbours saw this and were very confused when I said hello to them. But after that, I think I realized there was almost a protection in the notoriety that I’d gained, and I don’t know, I felt like it was almost safer for me to walk the streets than the people that I lived around because of my position in the whole situation. With that being said, like, when it comes to my day-to-day life, I’m a really friendly person. I know all of my neighbours. Well, I can’t say all of them, you know, but I know a good few of them. And one of -- like, really, one of the -- my, like, daily joys is chit chatting with them in the elevator and seeing them on the street and saying hello. And what was truly, truly terrible about this time was seeing how people I knew were being affected, and knowing that for every one person that I knew that was going through a difficult time because of what was going on, there were 20 other people that I didn’t know that were going through the same thing. I knew people that were being pushed out of their homes because they were literally having mental breakdowns because of the stress and the noise and just the terror they felt from the situation. And I don’t think anyone or anything can discount those real feelings that people experienced and people had. And because of the action I took, I had encouraged a lot of my friends and neighbours to reach out to me and tell me their stories because it was so important for people to know that this was a serious thing that was going on, that people were being really terribly affected by it. One of my neighbours, she had just had a new born baby. Her name is Hazel. She was maybe six months old at this time, but I remember -- like, I’ve watched Hazel. She’s a really sweet baby. But my friend, she had told me that the noise was so terrible that sometimes just to get her to sleep, she had to take the baby out into the hallway, as far from the windows as possible, and bounce her in the hallways to try and get her to sleep before bringing her back into the apartment, where there was just the unrelenting horns. And other neighbours who told me for just, you know, a good two/three hours of nap, whatever they could get, they would go down to the parking lot and sleep in their car because it was the only place that they could escape to. And for me, second to the hallway, my bathroom was a little quieter, so I got some peace there as well.",02-017-17,17,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS.

02-020-19,"I didn’t feel safe, but it’s hard to describe it as unsafe at the same time, because I was actively being so cognizant of my surroundings. I’m fast. I can move very fast. So, you know, I’m -- I was always ready to, you know, take myself out of a situation where something might happen. And, you know, a lot of the times, when they’re bouncing their trucks and their cars and -- I don’t know how to describe it other than, like, roaring at us, like, roaring at me with, like, these large giant vehicles. You know, it’s -- the idea was to move quick and get where we needed to go. And, you know, that was the intention, and that’s what you really had to do, I think, to stay safe, because when you didn’t take your time, they would always get to you. Like, not -- maybe not in the sense that you’re thinking, but they would try and come up to you and convince you that they were doing the right thing. And they would say to me -- like they -- I -- like, on more than one occasion, I would try and plead with them because, you know, there’s a certain desperation in being left in that kind of situation where the people that are supposed to help you weren’t helping you, and it was just ongoing for really -- it was going to be an unknown period of time, because really, every day I woke up and I hoped that it was over, and it never was.

02-021-18,"Yes. For two reasons. One, of course, the inability to negotiate those streets safely, because of lack of assisted -- well, lack of sound was the big thing. Also, being very concerned about what was underfoot, because there was debris on the streets, and it was winter, and icy, and slippery. And then always vigilant that someone was going to approach. On an occasion, there was a person who kept jumping in front of me. I was with someone else. I could only go out if someone came with me. And this person kept jumping in front and didn't allow me to pass. So when he was confronted, finally it stopped, but then sent messages, ""Well, I love you anyway"", he said. So that was a bit intimidating. And so in that way I didn't feel safe for those two reasons. I didn't have all the faculties I normally use; and secondly, that someone was going to approach me and either I was going to be accidentally hurt or I would -- or my big worries that I would bump into and hurt them too. So always vigilant and concerned. Does that mean I was feeling safe? No. No, I wasn't.

And as a result, I decided to organise a meeting with a number of residents in my building with some Ottawa Police community liaison officers, just so we could have a recorded account of what our experiences were, and really to, again, diffuse the tension, and really concretely say, ""You know what's happening here.

02-026-09,"When the trucks and other vehicles came into my area on the Friday evening, it was very loud. And on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, I could sense, I could sense the excitement and the electricity in the air. And at the beginning, I thought I am so happy to be in a country where there is freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom to assemble, but then that sentiment started to crumble as the loudness was all night and all that weekend. That's why I begged my friend, ""Can you just come and take me out for a short time even so I don't have to hear this?"" And the sounds continued constantly, until -- well, at night. And they may have been somewhat diminished because there was -- were crescendos all during the day, and toward the evening in particular, and then all night. When the injunction was put in place, then it abated a bit between 11 o'clock at night, and then 7 o'clock, I could hear activity out on the street. I could hear a huge megaphone starting to advise, it seemed to me, a rolling thunder of horn-blowing starting at 7:30 in the morning, and then the loud, loud music would, which you could hear every word of the music they were -- the songs that were being sung. So your question in terms of how loud it was, how continuous it was. It was continuous. There was an abatement of horn blowing in such a crescendo between those hours, 11:00 at night and 7:00 in the morning. But the idling continued under my window, just with these huge vehicles, the sound of the idling echoing down in the canyon of our buildings all night. So there was no respite from an assault on hearing. I tried to wear earplugs, but they kept falling out, and then I worried if I wore an earplug I wouldn’t be able to hear the smoke alarm, I wouldn’t be able to hear if somebody was pounding on my door to evacuate because there was something -- a fire or an explosion outside our door.

02-082-16,"So there -- things that pertain to businesses that are very specific in events like this, or -- and I'm sorry, I keep calling it an event. That's my knowledge. So things like will they have access to loading zones, how can deliveries happen, can staff get in, you know, where will the bus routes be, what -- and because there was so much fluidity to what was happening, there was no sense that the plan today was going to be the next -- the plan the next day. There was -- you know, there was some fluidity to it, but mostly, those are the things we needed to know. Can staff take OC Transpo and get from Vanier to their job at the Rideau Centre? Will the Rideau Centre be safe? You know, those are the things that pertain to businesses. Like, can we have -- can they have deliveries picked up? And can they still do click and collect? And can Uber Eats and Skip the Dishes get through? And to give context to it, though we're five kilometres away in Vanier from the downtown core, Uber Eats was not servicing. They were not servicing. So unlike what could be said to have happened to businesses during COVID, businesses were completely crippled, and that has to be understood by this Commission, because there were no deliveries. There was no loading zone. There was no Uber Eats. There was no clients in the stores. A lot of the protesters that arrived did support businesses and I'm not going to say that they didn't. They supported some businesses, but there was a lot of chaos. There was a lot of businesses that were deeply affected by protesters. And then there was this sense -- there was a lawlessness, if I can speak specifically to restaurants, which are often the most flexible of all of our businesses; right? They adapt very quickly. They can figure out things very quickly. But restaurants often had catering tables organized by protesters right outside their doors offering free hotdogs, free chocolates, free, you know, to everyone.

02-084-11,"Yeah, I think, again, it comes down to having been on Sparks Street for over nine years now and having a very veteran merchant mix. There wasn't initially going into it necessarily a lot of concern. So I, you know, again, having a bit more -- you know, dealing with protests and activation through the core all the time, again, I was -- as I said earlier, I felt that this was going to be large and boisterous, but not necessarily -- not obviously the three-week event that it was. So we -- and again, Sparks Street, we tend to be a little self-sufficient. So we were very active on social media, making sure we were getting information from OPS and bylaw, as we were directed to through Coms, and which was said the fastest way to get our information oftentimes was Twitter. And so Catherine did reach out to make sure that we had gotten what we had. And so again, yeah, it was very much I think we're good. The members are aware. Again, my members go into an event like this any other protest, not thinking about closing their doors, not really worried about -- concerned about staff. At events, as we always say -- I always say on Sparks Street, people march up to Parliament Hill determined to get their message out, to tell people about what they need -- what they think that needs to be told and say their piece and they leave satisfied and happy that they've accomplished what they set out to do, and then they end up visiting our coffeeshops and our restaurants, et cetera. It was only kind of into Saturday night, Sunday where we realised this was a different -- there was a different energy in the crowd, if I can use that term, and that's when I get a lot of my businesses, who on the Saturday were open or trying to open. Regulations in Ontario were starting to be lifted and they're being ready to be lifted on the Monday, on the 31st, and so our businesses were kind of actually getting ready for the provinces to reopened and to welcome customers back inside their businesses after a very long January, or yeah, January/December. So again, I wasn't overly concerned. There was a very casual nature to the conversation, and that's kind of how I speak and how I flow.",02-084-13,84,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

02-085-23,"In hindsight, yeah. I mean, as I say, I was -- here, I -- you know, I talked with staff. Along Sparks Street, we have bollards that can be installed. We use them in the spring, summer, fall to control traffic. They're out right now on the street if you're out there today. Wintertime we have to remove them for snow operations. So we had actually taken them out back in November and so the street was open. And again, it was at that point where at the same time we were just sitting there say, ""Okay, do you think we should put them in?"" You know, we started seeing vehicles coming in, we didn't want them on the street for what we thought was just the weekend. So my event supervisor and I made the decision, you know, we -- you know, we had to dig out the holes, and they're all full of snow and ice, and dig them out and vacuum them out and we put the posts in for the weekend. And I think it was kind of a fortunate decision for us to do that because I feel like the street would have ended up as kind of a secondary holding spot for vehicles and other activities.",02-085-25,85,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

02-086-16,"Yes. We had reached out to Constable Sean Kay, who we had a conversation with a couple of months ago for another activation. The constable's job is to liaise with marches and activations like that. So we had reached out to Sean to say ""Do you think we should do that? Is it going to interfere with Operations?"" Again, having a knowledge of the street, in the past when there have been activations or incidents, Sparks Street can sometimes become a holding spot for, or just a cut through for police services or other entities, Operations and such. So we just did a reach out saying, ""Is this going to interfere in any of your planning or any Operations?"" And he said, ""No, nothing, so just keep -- just let us know when it's done."" So we did that. Later, at the beginning of the week, I want to say about February 3rd or so, we had to -- we reached -- or 2nd, 2nd or 3rd, we reached back out to let him we were taking them out. They had done their job, they kept the vehicles off the street. The feeling was there was two things happening then. I felt that the vehicles couldn't move anymore, they were kind of jammed into the spaces, and we had snow falling, and so we had to pull them out so that snow clearing could happen. What ended up happening was there was no snow operations for the next three weeks, so you had a nice layer of snow and ice on Sparks Street that -- for the remaining of the convoy.",02-086-18,86,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

02-087-15,"We ended up removing them.

There was a lane for fire and such, but that was about it, and that was being respected by everyone. So -- and it would have been -- again, these were mechanical, all -- they're not all automated, it's not a heat system, it's a pretty simple system, but by that time to get -- to put them back in was going to be very difficult after a snow event.",02-087-17,87,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And they also reported that large groups of protestors, you know, by large I probably mean 3 to 10, would come in at once and then do the sort of thing that was, you know, that is now sort of cliché, but would go up to the workers with masks on and say, ""Why are you wearing a mask? Why are you doing this?"" They would disrupt the sort of general, you know, the store, they would disrupt the store. And there was also evidence or not evidence, sorry, there was things that were relayed to me that they -- the protestors had been putting up posters throughout the store that looked like public health posters, but saying things like, ""masks are stupid, or masks aren't needed"", or you know, so counterintuitive sort of things that staff... Nothing, you know, violent, but definitely disruptive. The most terrifying call I had was on the last -- the third weekend, where the manager was talking to me, and he said, ""You know, Nathalie, I don't know if this is something but I feel like I should tell you.

It was difficult for them. I mean, businesses that were open would suddenly end up with five, 10, 15 people in the store unmasked wanting to use the bathroom, or just to warm up, not actually getting any services, especially if it was a retail business. Food businesses initially in that first weekend, you know, reported me to -- staff would report to me that they had difficulty managing the customers coming in. Businesses were, of course, were under the regulations for the closure and such, so if they were allowing customers in, those customers had to be masked, there was limits on what they could do. It was impossible for them to enforce it. And that was something I think we did bring up on one of the calls eventually, which was -- and then, again, initially we were told, “No, it’s up to the business to enforce that. The business has to make the decision whether they’re going to stay open or closed. It’s up on the business.” And then it was brought to their attention it’s quite impossible for a single shop owner to police five or six people who are in -- determined not to follow the local health ordinances.

It closed and that cost them $2 million a day and they were closed for three - - three weekends, the worst of which would be Valentines Day and Canada -- and Family Day. And I think for businesses, we have to state how important that is. I have a business, Quelque Chose Patisserie, they have their bakery and -- sorry, I’m going quickly -- their bakery in Vanier they also have two other franchises, now three, but because -- and they had trouble at the Byward one so they closed down, but that affected the bakery and it affected also Westboro, because their Westboro location people were told to stay home, so they didn’t have it. So again, that is -- that losing -- for that bakery to lose Valentines Day and Family Day weekend carries them through the first quarter.

02-100-27,"I just think it’s difficult to explain because -- it’s been very difficult sometimes for us to explain how devastating it's been for our business community and the downtown core. You know, I prime example I think was an example that was about halfway through the event I'm in line that night, after spending 12 hours on the street, in the line at a coffee shop in Kanata, just to pick up some coffee for the next morning for my family, and I'm looking inside this coffee shop and I’m seeing customers inside. And immediately my brain said, “Oh my God, they’re in violation of the health orders”, da, da, da, and then I realized, no, the rest of the province has been allowed to open, it's just downtown Ottawa. And I think that's the effect that this had, was because this activation happened for as long as it did, police directed the residents and visitors to not come downtown. It's something we still deal with today with the Wellington closure and such, and the reputation of the city and the downtown. We've already seen in tourism numbers this summer, they are down. We’re continuing to see that the reputation of the city has been -- as a place to visit, has been greatly tarnished and it's going to take us years to truly recover from that in the downtown core, if we ever do.",02-100-29,100,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

02-101-22,"I have two things I would add. One, just to say to that, I have friends who, you know, decided that they would have this beautiful Ottawa staycation David summer, and they go, and they bike, you know, and they go to the market, and then there sitting out in the market at the end of this really amazing day, and then all of a sudden this protest comes up and people start yelling and screaming, and so this was months afterwards. So to Kevin's point, it's still happening now, there's still disruption to businesses. The second point I'd like to make in closing is that, and I don't know this has been tackled, but Vanier is the most diverse BIA of all the BIAs in Ottawa and we have the highest level of racialized people within -- or racialized business owners. So MacArthur specifically is the street which is the closest street to the convoy, a street that is very multicultural and has a lot of, you know, a lot of specific cultural groceterias, restaurants, those types of things. Anecdotally, there was a lot of -- it was very difficult for some of those business owners, and though they may or may not have closed, the sense -- and I think, you know, the speakers this morning sort of talked to that, there was a sense of like, foreboding in the city. There was this intense feeling, and specifically, one of our organizations that we worked quickly with was targeted, or not targeted, was intimidated to a certain extent by having men standing outside their windows looking in, again, comments being made, and this is a shelter for Indigenous women and children. So you know, it has to be said that the damage done, I think was somewhat disproportionate to those in our city that are equity seeking and equity deserving, especially our small businesses.",02-101-24,101,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

02-149-11,"Well, there were limitations on how much coverage there was, so each business was 15,000 total. So -- which depending on the size of business, so while, you know, you may not have hit the full use of the fund, an individual business may have only incurred 2 or $3,000 of expenses during that time, it didn't cover potential lost sales, as an example. So that's obviously a big thing, so you weren't able to factor in your gross revenues lost that you could compare to a couple years ago or year before. Your rent may not have been the full coverage amount. The other side would be is that a larger operator, a large independent restaurant would potentially -- the rent would be $10,000. So the 10,000 or $15,000 was really insignificant to their operating costs. So it was -- I would say that the majority of my members did -- absolutely benefitted from that funding. It was very much appreciated, especially in the way -- how quickly it flowed into the downtown businesses that were affected -- I'll use the word unprecedented positively in the sense of how quickly it came in. Unfortunately, for a lot of businesses, it didn't quite meet what they needed in order to make the recovery from the three, four weeks of business loss. I would also say that because businesses specifically on Sparks Street were actually fenced in after the protesters, an activation was moved because the security perimeter was kept up for an additional week. So there was a lot of limited -- a number of businesses in the downtown core were affected for a week after the occupation was done.",02-149-13,149,13,11,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

They were surprised when -- and frustrated and angry when the city and/or police allowed trucks to actually enter non-truck routes. So trucks -- very large trucks parked along Queen Elizabeth Driveway, for example, which is not a truck route, and stayed there for the weekend, and then coming down Kent, Metcalfe, O’Connor. So there was, you know, that first weekend, more of a bracing just to kind of get through the weekend. Started to see almost immediately -- and I started to receive emails and it was on social media -- symbols of hatred, you know, swastikas and Confederate flags, you know, Pride flags being, you know, targeted, so there was fear. Certainly, people that first weekend who were reporting back to me, and calling me, and emailing were fearful but they were braced for it and, you know, had been told that would it end on Monday and waited for that. So after Monday, when it didn’t end, it just became -- you know, in the words of people who were, you know, calling me and talking to me, they felt that they were under a great deal of threat, seniors reporting that they, you know, had trouble going out, they felt threatened when they went into a grocery store, you know, residents not being able to leave their apartments. I had to help on couple leave the downtown with a police escort on the first weekend. There was a Pride flag in their window. They’re apartment was targeted. Somebody had defecated on the back step. And then later that night, you know, a pickup truck with angry people in it came back and were harassing and yelling at them so, at that point, they felt very unsafe and we had a police escort them out.

02-164-20,"So just to recognize that everything my colleague said is very similar to the realities I face -- that our communities face. I would add that the number of closures -- we have, in my community, one of the largest commercial properties, which is the Rideau Centre located at the corner of Rideau and Colonel By. There’s 300 business in the Rideau Centre. I’m told by the general manager, close to 3000 employees, and they were forced to close on the first Saturday and it took them about four hours, with help from police, to properly close the facility. Many of the businesses in the Byward Market -- there’s around -- it’s hard to give you an official because there’s businesses along Rideau Street; there’s businesses in the Byward Market. Many of them closed for the weekend and never reopened. Those who stayed open, many closed after that first weekend because of incidents with staff. And many incidents were reported relating -- there were a number of restrictions in place at the time? Mask wearing -- restaurants were not open. There’s a number of elements like that which created many incidents with part-time restaurant staff in the Byward Market and on Rideau Street. And then the non-stop noise of that first weekend, we have, as you've seen this morning and as we’ve encountered through the realities of walking through the site and communication with businesses and residents, just a non- liveable area for folks who lived in the Byward Market, lived on Rideau Street, lived on the northern part of Sandy Hill. Non- stop noise, the intimidation when they went out, specifically if they followed regulations and wore masks. There were a number of incidents where bus detours had to be conducted and we have communications with residents who, for example, waited for a Para-Transpo -- Para- Transpo is the accessible bus of Ottawa -- and couldn’t get to their cancer treatment because the bus couldn’t get there and they were not mobile. There were a number of incidents, as you know, and both Councillor McKenney and I, we have the LRT, the tunnel section. So if you want to access transit you have to walk -- go through long escalators to the platform. And there were a lot of movements between St. Laurent Shopping Centre and the downtown core. And many incidents on those trains that went unreported. And you know, fortunately OC Transpo did adapt but those first few days to weekends it was quite challenging. And so much so that many of the transit routes downtown just didn’t operate.",02-164-22,164,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

02-167-07,"Well, for us, you know, having the physical truck on the street created a big weapon in the spirit of the noise, the pollution of the fumes, the ability for folks to operate their businesses, to open, for us to offer services. There were a lot of rigs at the corner of Sussex and Rideau, and Rideau Centre is kind of that connection point on transit and for many of the access in and out of the market and on transit for routes that are coming from the western part of downtown and the eastern part of downtown. So not having access to that Rideau Sussex intersection created that congestion in that space. So I mean, I could go on and on but I think you get the picture that there were really really -- you couldn’t. You couldn’t live in that space. It was non-stop noise, non-stop pollution. You couldn’t get out because you’d hear yells. You’d get yelled at. There were a number of micro aggressions on the periphery of the red zone, particularly in residential communities which both Catherine and I lived firsthand and heard directly from residents. And then through the weekend it was this influx of pickup trucks who would not follow rules. Like, for example, in the market, you know, the Byward Market -- and just to locate you a little bit, at the corner of Byward and George Street there’s The Bay on one side. So there’s this big kind of sidewalk, if you will, that leads to Sussex. The road is pretty defined. It’s a one lane in each direction with parking bays on each side. Well, pickup trucks were just parked anywhere and everywhere in any direction, on the sidewalk, in vehicular lanes, so even if residents or businesses, for example like The Bay, Chapters, and so on -- their loading zone is right there. They couldn’t physically get garbage in and out or their equipment if they wanted to open. So you kind of -- I’m giving you an example. It was the same issues along Rideau. It was the same issues along Nicholas, and in different parts of the Byward Market.",02-167-09,167,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

02-168-17,"So I started to go out after the first weekend, Monday, when we knew that, you know, about 80 percent of the large trucks left. But the 20 percent that were left were remaining and had -- you could see no intention of leaving anytime soon. And as Councillor Fleury said, we would get this surge of people coming into the city who were sympathetic to the, you know, original convoy that had entered. I started to go out at that week, walk around. I would go through the convoy and observe. I would meet with residents who were feeling threatened. I delivered food to some people. I delivered pet food to some people, in particular, who were living in some of our community housing buildings who felt very threatened and not able to go out. I organized one -- what we called the safety walk so that we could come out together as a community. And that happened the second week. But you know, we stayed within the residential area away from, you know, where the convoy had taken root. We had organized a second one and we called it off because the environment just felt more threatening and I didn’t -- my fear through all of this and my key concern through all of this was the safety of residents that I represent. You know, there was nothing more on my mind than the safety of the people that live in the city and that I represent. So you know, again it would get the surge on the weekends and you know, I have stated before and I will again, you know, I was always careful when I went down, walked through the convoy. I was accosted on a few occasions but not, you know -- never felt that I was in any real danger. But walking home through the residential streets was always when I felt the most threatened. It’s often when I was threatened. You know, homophobic slurs, transphobic slurs, just you know, people recognizing me from media or other means. So it was more, you know, on the streets going home it was more those isolated incidents that were the greatest threat throughout the -- and that’s what I heard from residents as well. You know, it was uncomfortable. They had to stay safe walking through the convoy especially if they wore a mask, racialized.

And obviously we have -- we’re used to protests in Ottawa, we’re used to events, we’re used to Canada Day, where 100,000 people come to downtown core and celebrate our country. There’s enough parking. There’s parking underground, there’s parking in the ByWard Market, paid parking. The rules of parking were not followed. People would park in any direction, would park on sidewalks. In a very pedestrian area, if you know the ByWard Market, it's small businesses, storefronts. It's really clear where you're supposed to park and where is the pedestrian route. So the surge of vehicles, pickups, is one of the aspects, and we saw that in different areas of my community. The Biker's Church in Vanier was one area. De La Salle High School was another one. Along Rideau Street and the ByWard Market were other areas. Nicholas were others. So there's that -- those incidents of people not following the rules of the road in pickup trucks, which is a different vehicle, which is a weapon in itself. But the weaponized description to me is really the rigs who take space on the street and make noise through the horns that you've shown in video. The fumes -- and I know reading through the evidence preparing for this, we weren't informed of Ottawa Public Health and the risk to the health, but we were getting a lot of complaints from business operators and residents in the area of the smells, the intoxication of those smells. So the compounding effect of noise, smells, the physical presence, the inability for folks to in some areas walk on the sidewalk, walk safely at a crosswalk. We have, like any community, folks with mobility needs, and getting on and off a curb anywhere and everywhere doesn't work safely. So that's the description of the weapon is that that truck took space on the road. The truck itself created an environment that was unsafe for the immediate neighbours and made it impossible for the -- what is our responsibility in terms of safety and wellbeing of residents and businesses in our community to safely live and be in the zone.",02-182-05,182,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

02-186-26,"Yeah, absolutely. If you look at the date of this, I believe the red zone was smaller, and only encompassed sections west of the canal. And police were, at the time, describing their presence in the red zone. So they -- although we were sharing community concerns on the periphery of the red zone, the reports we were getting back from the Ottawa Police was few incidents in the red zone and presence in the red zone, which our focus was where we were hearing concerns, on the periphery. It's not a new issue in Ottawa. I want to be clear. Like, we have about 99 demonstrations a year. Every time there's a demonstration in Ottawa, local taxpayers of Ottawa lose their local police force to those demonstrations. That means neighbourhood officers that are in Centretown, in the ByWard Market, in Vanier are then focused on whatever is the demonstration. In this instance, that was the initial, but it grew into something much more significant because of no actions. There were incidents, vehicles driving on the sidewalk, police nearby not taking action. So it grew into a lot of questions from all of us, including residents and businesses on what -- are we in a state of chaos? Who's going to respond to elements that are happening that we wouldn't tolerate from just living in society or living in our city. And the -- not to lower the issues of the red zone, but the -- where we were pushing for more presence and support from community members was on the periphery of the red zone where folks were either living in the red zone, going to shop or getting out of the zone, and the number of incidents, or the opposite, coming into work, and there were incidents. I shared with you in one of our conversations the situation in the Rideau LRT. Rideau LRT is our biggest LRT station, largest volume in the city. Ottawa Police refused to go into the LRT Station. I had to get the head of OC Transpo to come and meet with us. She recognized the incidents; they see it on camera. There’s a bunch of CCTV cameras through our LRT network. They brought special constables in. She had to go herself and her leadership team in red vests to give a sense that there was safety in these stations because the Ottawa Police refused to go in.",02-186-28,186,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Through, you know, some communication, it was decided that people would go down and try to stop these vehicles from coming in and joining the occupation.

02-207-15,"No. We were often repeated the same public information that was available earlier in the day. There were some very specific questions, “How can I make sure that food can enter the zone so that my deliveries can continue?” “Can I -- how can I accommodate that --” for example, we know during the covid period, the Uber pick ups and the food distributions were very important. They couldn’t -- those vehicles couldn’t access the zone. So there’s a number of business issues that came to that table, and ultimately it’s, “Hey, City AOPS, what’s the plan? Should we be worried? Are you, you know --” and then, “Oh, these amounts of businesses are closed. What can we do about them?” It became complex, right, because you had employees of those businesses, you had to pay rent, then couldn’t pay rent, so then another set of conversation was there, like the group that represents the BIA were at the table as well. Then we hit a period between, obviously, January and February, where you have to -- those landlords need their pay, so those commercial businesses had to negotiate with their landlords. So that was another set of conversations. So there wasn’t one conversation theme. It was all about how do we get back to operating? How can we get back to operate safely in the area? It is an important time for us at the city. I think that’s the other measure that’s maybe not understood, is those weekends, late January, early February, are the Winterlude, is when we celebrate the winter activities, and there’s thousands of residents who come to the downtown, and visitors who come to skate on the Canal, to enjoy what we have to offer as a winter capital city. And those businesses were at -- there was restriction loosening at that point. So they were also hoping -- they had prepared -- they had purchased food, they had prepared their staff for larger gatherings. None related to the convoy, just preparing to the period. And yet often had to return them home. So there’s a number of -- Rideau Centre shared with us, and that was covered in the news, there are 3,000 employees at the Rideau Centre. Most of them are part time staff. And, you know, like the Apple Store, it’s 200 staff at the Apple Store. You have food, food court, and chefs, and you have cleaners, you have security.

02-209-11,"Yeah. I’ve gone through a lot of crises, unfortunately, as I’ve described earlier. Usually very important information is provided at a white table from the City and other media authorities for what all residents need to know in terms of what would impact them, and then there are stakeholder information. “Can I get -- is transit going to operate? Can I get my distributers in? Is it safe to walk on the streets?” Those are the types of basic information that our business members were trying to get from the City. And we were creating that area, that daily space, with few interactions. And we kind of saw a number of situations where the City is there, the City is adapting, it’s closing streets, it’s removing, you know, some of the parking areas. It’s adapted. Do you remember in part of it, like, there’s a closure of bridges. So the City, from an operation point of view, is adapting. Bylaw, not so much so. Not because of their own doing, but because they fit into this command centre, you know, police operations, who call the shots on what can be enforced and not. And through that, there’s a number of concerns. How are we communicating to the members? How are we communicating the public? What’s the risk to residents? I know that one of the documents you have is around a pick-up truck with gas in the Rideau Centre parking lot. I can assure you today, if a pick-up truck showed up with gas, they would evacuate -- police would evacuate, police and fire, and all the authorities would show up, they’d evacuate the mall. In that situation, they’d remove the vehicle extremely quickly. They’d protect the public safety, and after that, they would remove the situation. No response to that. I mean, you have a pretty extensive thread by the General Manager at the Rideau Centre and what I’ll call confusion amongst authorities, and ultimately very fortunate that the Rideau Centre was able to support the -- find the operator and get them out of the situation. I mean, that’s the type of uncoordinated approach at a very microlevel that we weren’t able to get clarity to local businesses. And hence, I mean, you’d think about all of the residential properties and what it takes for people to go in and out of their properties, to access transit, to get their vehicles out. So it was chaos for both Catherine and I, not just on the business and the operations of that, but on the residents’ concerns. And we had little information or little hope of a plan that was going to be enacted to bring back safety and well being for residents in our city’s core.",02-209-13,209,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Like, that’s the -- you know, we’re very fortunate that no more serious kind of life incident in those particular situations happened, because having the manager of the Château Laurier share that with their member association and for the member association to say, “What’s going on in City operations?

02-216-06,"Bylaw is an automatic mechanism in the City and sometimes it kind of slings back at them. But you call 311 if there’s a violation, someone is parked on the street illegally or -- we have -- in the Byward Market, Bylaw goes proactively and tickets. If you didn’t pay for parking or if you’re not parked properly, they’ll tow you. So, in regular operations, Bylaw is on the ground on parking. It's respect -- ensuring that some of those rules -- and in more complex situations where, you know, if there is noise, if there is a fire, then different authorities in and around Bylaw, like Fire Services or others, will come and intervene. We, as councillors, don’t intervene in that. It’s an automatic process through 311 and when there are incidents, or if there’s lack of follow up, then often the resident would inform us and then we would convey that or connect with the police -- with the fire chief -- sorry, the Bylaw chief and their team and they would follow up accordingly with the resident without political influence. It’s important for us to inform, connect, but very -- you know, we know were are authorities are. They’re through motions of council, not influencing operations in that regard. And what was frustrating is the amount of parking in illegal lots, or even in the Byward Market, and vehicles that were abandoned, or vehicles that were improperly parked, and we’d convey that through to the authorities and it was this chain of command. Instead of going through a 311 and Bylaw goes out and responds, it was the 311 call is referred to police in the command centre and if the command centre judges that that is an applicable element, then they would share with Bylaw. But the problem is they didn’t. They were so focused on the red zone or the elements of the red zone that even basic Bylaw services that we would expect were not enforced, which compounded a lot of the tension point, and so much so that we came to realize that there was a trend. If you call 3-1-1 and there was an illegal parker, the operator would say, “Okay. Can you describe the vehicle?” Oh, there’s a flag. And then it was already Police Command. Even if we were outside of the red zone, like we’re talking, you know, blocks and blocks away.

We were trying to find a way to see a plan, an enforcement, so that we could get back to the safety and wellbeing for residents and businesses. For us there were a number of instances. You talk about the curfew. We have the Police Chief who tells us, “Well, there’s no more canister movement.” And then that continues. And then all of a sudden we get the pressure from residents in the city saying, “What’s happening? Like, why aren’t rules being followed?” So I know you want me to address that particular point. I guess my point is there was a number of these ideas that were shared with us that we passed along and either through formal motions of Council when I moved to asked the Chief Justice to change the bylaw fines for an increase, or the curfew examples are there as well.

02-235-06,"Well, certainly as I indicated earlier; to have an engaged Council and staff looking at all options, which included in the end injunctions, injunctions, you know, on horns, injunctions on idling, but with strength. Certainly that would have, at the very least, eased some of the stressors, the pressures that residents were, you know, under throughout this -- throughout the siege. You know, in the end I still pen that it was our local police who, you know, in the beginning made a -- you know, a serious error in allowing trucks to come into our City off of routes. Actually I think they put up signs and actually, you know, pointed to where they could park and that. And then, you know, our federal government, our provincial government, not responding in a way that in any way suggested that they, you know, felt that having their capital under siege, or losing their capital. Really, we had a residential neighbourhood that was lost, that was under siege and no other level of government was taking it seriously. And until that happened, you know, we weren’t going to see an end to the occupation. And it really was about the resources in the end. It really was about what I called for early in the occupation.

02-236-03,"I support the idea of an earlier injunction. It’s pretty obvious now. The state of emergency, although symbolic, was used by provincial and federal elected officials to advance dismantling or solutions to dismantle our by-laws. It took a while for us to raise the fines -- and not just raising the fines, but actually untangling the command of the by-laws and make -- you know, start eating away at the red zone and start limiting the impact in the residential and main streets of Ottawa. The way the city communicated with residents, I think there was also a lot of concerns around, you know, call 311, but then if 311 is not -- if it doesn’t work, then what happens? So, you know, I think there’s a lot of this. And I want to come back to one of the points, which was on the -- I believe it was the Wednesday or the Thursday prior to the convoy arrival -- it was the 26th of January; we were briefed by Chief Sloly at the time Kim Ayotte and a number of councillors, I believe, including Councillor McKenney, Councillor Brockington and Councillor Egli, who’s a lawyer by profession, we asked “Will our truck routes be respected?” and we were said -- we were told no because of a charter I won’t recite because I’m not a lawyer. But then, for us, from an outside perspective, hey, the following weekend, they’re at Queen’s Park, they’re in Quebec City, and wait a minute, the trucks are controlled. They’re not walking right into the front doors. And adding to that, we’re weeks into that, days into that, trucks are moving in and out of the zone, moving. It’s like, “Whoa.” It’s like a triple effect of this. Like, we didn’t -- there wasn’t a plan in place to limit truck movement. Then truck movement continued and there was no operational resolution to that like, “Okay, you can’t move in the red zone. You’re out of the red zone. We’re not letting you back in.” That took until basically the last days before that was taken seriously.",02-236-05,236,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

02-237-16,"Well, certainly his response to me, as the councillor, you know, responsible for the residents for the downtown, of Somerset ward, I never received a phone call from the mayor. It wasn’t until somebody mentioned it publicly that a meeting was called, myself, and several councillors, and the police chief, and the mayor. So, you know, there was no attempt to work with me to provide guidance, to provide resources, support for, you know, residents. It’s not about me personally. I didn’t need any of that but the people I represent certainly did. You know, there was no urgency from the mayor to respond, to provide the information that people needed, to respond to the concerns that were, you know -- you know, that were being brought to his attention and that of many others. I forwarded, in the end, many, many emails and instances of, you know, chaos in the -- you know, in the residential areas. So yeah, it was very difficult.

But I think I’m going to bring it up to kind of the conversation that it needs to have which is, you know, the mayor represents every resident of Ottawa. And when there is an area that is impacted, you want to work with closely with the mayor, and legal team, and so on so that everyone’s on board with the actions, right. So I bring you back to that period. You know, I’m the only councillor, basically, at City Hall. I can’t work from home; I’m at City Hall; I’m in my office. That entire building’s empty. Like, it’s empty. So, you know, there’s the factor of where councillors live, where the mayor lives, where City staff live. They’re seeing it on their screen. They’re seeing it on social media. They’re not living it. So I’m not casting a blame. I’m describing the period, right. There’s a period of time where people are behind their screen at home. We’re living the impacts in real time and it happen extremely quick. And then, you know, there’s the other piece, which is the period -- like, the crisis. At the City -- again, I go back -- I mean I’m young but getting old. Twelve years later, we’ve had a lot of crises 00 flooding, power outages, a recent derecho, the sinkhole on Rideau. It’s pretty standard what you see at the City. There’s a table -- a white table with nametags, a water bottle. You’ll have communication. You’ll have the service lead; that would be -- throughout Covid, it was Public Health. Through other crisis, it might have been Hydro Ottawa. It might have been a city official, the mayor, and maybe other jurisdiction. I didn’t see that white table during this situation, ever. And out of all the crises I’ve seen, it’s a bit unique that I didn’t see that and I’d love -- he’s never -- I’ve never asked; he’s never explained it; but that to me is, like -- as someone who’s lived the crisis at the City of Ottawa, it’s atypical of not seeing that confident, “We have a plan,” informing residents. It came through but it came through the police chief, through police communication, and some City information which was often criticized because of street closures and the tone that was used in City communications and police communications in the first few weeks.",02-238-13,238,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And this council meeting was Wednesday. I was very, very concerned -- more than concerned. I was really quite frightened that another weekend would bring, you know, just so much more chaos. We just could not go through another weekend. And I was very concerned -- you know, that the mayor was relaying to council and to the public that trucks had been relocated off of residential streets. I decided, you know, probably an hour before council that I had to do something and I went down to Kent Street and I -- you know, I called in council from there to demonstrate that these trucks were still here. I needed people to see what was happening. It was very difficult because you would hear from people -- I would get emails. I got an exceptional amount of hate throughout the whole three and a half weeks but it was getting worse -- personal threats to myself, my family -- and there was so much -- people were dismissing what was happening -- not everyone, of course. I got tremendous support from across the city, people emailing me they saw what was happening and they supported that, but I just did feel that police, the City, or -- had a plan for the weekend. It was Wednesday night -- Wednesday night. We just couldn’t. Friday was the day that it all began again. So it was really a plea and a demonstration to everyone watching, what was happening to people who live here on Kent Street. You can see the residential towers on Kent Street.

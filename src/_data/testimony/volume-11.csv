However, if it was an emerging and emergent circumstance, those types of needs for resources would be coordinated either by our provincial Communication Centres or our provincial Operation Centres. And if it was a long, protracted event or a planned activity, we would establish what we'd call an Emergency Operations Centre, and our Emergency Management Unit would be involved in that very complex process.",11-015-26,15,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

If it was for additional uniform officers, it would go to Field Operations, public order would go to Field Support Bureau through what we call TSOS, Traffic Safety and Operational Support. That does not alleviate local municipalities reaching out directly to a detachment or to a regional commander, but formal requests for assistance should come in through my office.

It would take integration, cooperation from across the province and perhaps outside of Ontario, which it did. There were more than 20 police services that ended up contributing to the final operation.

11-087-07,"I can’t say at what point in time I would have had conversations with the Deputy Solicitor-General over the need to prioritize. I can tell you that I did have open conversations with the Deputy Solicitor- General over how we prioritized operationally our resources. And once the blockade had occurred in Windsor and we had been asked for formal assistance, there was a request for 100 OPP officers and 100 RCMP officers that came into our possession a very similar way as the Ottawa request. It was forwarded directly to the Province as opposed to me. And it had come in only, I believe, hours after I had already spoken with the Chief of Windsor and offered support and was advised that there was no additional assistance required. And certainly throughout that entire period, I made my decisions known to the Deputy Solicitor-General when appropriate, that when it was time to deploy Public Order to Windsor, that we did not have a defined plan in Ottawa yet. Therefore, we did not know exactly how many resources were required. That the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor was something that we felt we could clear up in two to four days. Ottawa would be five to 10 days at least once a plan was established. We also had concurrent events happening in Toronto at Queen’s Park. We had attempts being planned to put blockades at the Peace Bridge in Niagara. We still said -- had Highway 402 on the go. We had plans emerging to attempt to block the bridge in Cornwall. We had things happening in Nippagon. So it was a priority to resolve Windsor. First, we had the resources available, ready. We had a plan ready to go.

I would suggest that perhaps factories start shutting down, people start losing employment. People may start to lose their homes, et cetera. That’s a significant economic that affects quality of life in community and in those conditions can affect crime in community, so it is something that needs to be considered in and amongst all of the other factors that we need to weigh as it relates to public safety, quality of life in community and the bigger picture of national security.

We also had plans that we were for the Peace Bridge, so by having Public Order assets in Windsor, we can quickly pivot between the Ambassador Bridge and the Peace Bridge. We can pivot over to the Blue Water Bridge. That’s a big difference from being in Ottawa. Make no mistake about it, I believe that it was by intent and design that we had activities happening at the furthest points from each other in southern Ontario. It is not circumstance that we had an occupation in the City of Ottawa and we had a blockage at the Ambassador Bridge at the exact same time. That was intentionally designed to challenge the capacity of our police, so that had to be very strategically and methodically managed to ensure that when we took action, it just didn’t disperse a problem and make it so it was unmanageable.

And so I want to understand if you agree with these sentiments about what Ottawa represented, what Windsor represented, and the fact that law enforcement couldn’t clear both at the same time?",11-094-17,94,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU (Cont'd),MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,eric brousseau
11-095-03,"So it’s absolutely true that law enforcement could not clear both at the same time. I don’t think it’s fair to try to separate them in terms of assessment and/or necessarily in terms of risk. We have to separate them in terms of prioritizing where we can take action first, based on the level of risk and the amount of resources available. I think for an accurate description of what was happening at the time, you truly need to go to the Hendon Report of February the 7th. And in that report, in the Hendon Report, the assessment is, taking into the consideration of the totality of all the events around the province and the country, that it posed a possible threat to national security. That was clearly defined in the Hendon Report. So it is impossible to separate all of these events and say, “I’m going to deal with this one in isolation, and when I’m done this one, I’m then going to move to the next.” It couldn’t be managed that way. And if you look at the evolving increase in police resources in Ottawa at the time, during that same time period, the 12th to the 14th of February, I think you will find that the number of OPP resources in Ottawa almost doubled during that time period. So it wasn't as if attention was taken away from any one particular event, this all had to be managed as a multi-jurisdictional event happening concurrently, all connected to each other. And whether there is evidence to prove that they were connected, that is irrelevant at this stage. This is about a strategy that ensures we can mitigate the risks that were before us as a province and as a country, and that needed to be done in a strategic way.",11-095-05,95,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

11-096-12,"Well, you may want to go to the 19th of February, which I believe there is similar language around that. And with your indulgence, Commissioner, I think it is important to talk about the terminology. When we say ""potential threat"" the term ""threat"" in a Strategic Intelligence report is to indicate something could happen. This is not about establishing a threshold as defined in the CSIS Act under section 2, and not even defining the threshold of reasonable grounds to pursue charges as terrorist activity. This is talking from a strategic level what are the risks that need to be taken into consideration when making decisions and developing plans? So the word ""potential"" is almost immaterial. It's like saying ""there's a threat of rain today."" Does it change the situation when you say ""there's a potential threat of rain today""? I would suggest to you it does not. What is required is further analysis of that threat, and Hendon POIB did have those conversations with the appropriate security partners, CSIS, as well as INSET, the Integrated National Security Enforcement Team, to see if that potential threat rose to the point that would warrant them enacting their mandates for the items that they're responsible for. And in the -- as we know, is in the CSIS Act, it says ""the security of Canada."" It doesn't actually say national security. Public Safety Canada goes to a much broader context when describing national security, and one of the items in national security, if you look at the national security strategy and how it's described by Public Safety Canada, actually includes impact to economy, activities at critical infrastructures, international border crossings. So as you can see, it's a very complex situation that requires detailed analysis.",11-096-14,96,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU (Cont'd),COMM.

That may have allowed Ottawa to be cleared sooner if there was a plan in place ready to go. The plan, to my understanding, was not in place and was not ready to go on February the 12th. It's not until February the 13th that there is a plan in place agreed upon by all the stakeholders that is a safe and viable plan to proceed with, and we were done in Windsor with positive action at that point, we were in a maintenance phase, and all roads were opened up I believe on February the 14th.

We had offered or agreed to lend the support of Superintendent Morris to assist him in communicating with the Board as well as Chief Superintendent Carson Pardy was supposed to attend that Police Service Board meeting. So I had undertaken the task of speaking with Chief Sloly when he was free to ask if he would consider if he needed or was willing to allow us to assume command and control if we were not able to move the plan forward had we got to that point that there were enough barriers in place that the plan was not going to move forward.

11-120-05,"“Lost confidence” is a harsh and strong way of putting it. This is a police service that is in a very unenviable position, is struggling to move forward with an operational plan. My job was to support them, provide whatever assistance was required to see that plan succeed, and to have that further dialogue with Chief Sloly to determine whether he felt that could be done under the current command structure or whether us taking command and control of that incident, allowing them to focus and he to focus on the policing responsibilities for the entire rest of the city, may be a resolution to that. Subject to the outcome of that phone call, I would have then had to make a determination as to whether I had confidence or did not and whether I escalated that to the Ministry. But at that point, I needed to have that conversation with Chief Sloly. All of the information that we were receiving about the obstacles and challenges that were not firsthand, I owed it to him to have that conversation and to offer our support.

And if not, can you help us understand what that paragraph means?",11-131-08,131,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU (Cont'd),MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,eric brousseau
11-131-22,"Yeah, this is correspondence that was pulled together with assistance from Legal Team, trying to satisfy the requirements of our procurement policies as it relates to engaging these services. Not compelling them I think is somewhat semantic in that tow trucks were coordinated, they were organized, they appeared willing to proceed. Many of them wanted indemnification, which was not something that we could provide them with without making additional arrangements through emergency provisions with the province. So when the Emergencies Act was invoked, that ability to provide that indemnification was extremely helpful. We were also concerned at the time that those that had agreed to provide their services would back out as we got closer to the operation. So technically, could we have compelled them? Did we provide them with information in writing that would insinuate they were compelled? Quite likely. But did we actually have to direct them? No, they had willingly agreed to assist. It was the indemnification that was the issue, and we were trying to make sure that with new legislation and procurement processes that everything was done appropriately and legally.",11-131-24,131,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

11-133-02,"Okay. Commissioner Carrique, in my last sort of 10 minutes, I want to ask you a few bigger picture questions. And the first one is about incident command. You are one of very few people who are going to testify at this Commission who has sat atop a police organization. And so I'm sure the Commissioner will be interested in your thoughts on proper role of a Police Chief when it comes to the Incident Command System.",11-133-04,133,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU (Cont'd),MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,eric brousseau
11-133-10,"So proper role of a Police Chief, depending on the -- depends on the situation. It depends on the circumstance. It depends on the size of the police service and the capacity of a police service. For a small police service, a Chief of Police may fulfil many roles, some of which will be very operational. To mid and large-size police services where the larger the police service, the more distant the Chief of Police becomes from operations. Ideally, your Chief of Police would be that of a strategic level, if they have the necessary, qualified people within their command to fulfil the other operational roles. But what is most important is there's clarity on command and control. When embarking upon any situation, planned or unplanned, there needs to be that clarity of command. And you will have likely have heard reference to SMEAC, which is the operation planning format, Situation, Mission, Execution, and Communication or Command and Control, depending what form you use. And those terms need to be clearly defined who is in charge, who has what roles, and who has what responsibilities. There are various forms of Incident Command Structure. What would be very helpful is having a consistent Incident Command Structure that is relied upon by policing right across Canada.",11-133-12,133,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

11-134-08,"--- earlier, and that set out the situations under which the OPP might be called on to assist.

11-134-14,"I think given all that we've experienced as of late, I think it's very worthwhile being revisited and appropriate consultation taking place with the affected police leaders, with the affected police boards. I don't think it would be fair to suggest that, you know, I as the Commissioner of the OPP would necessarily have the authority to go in and take over operations, but I think there is value in examining a mechanism by which a threshold could easily be identified that would allow that to happen seamlessly, and more integration as it relates leading up to these events. So if, you know, we can take one lesson away from this, it would be absolutely ideal that we had one central repository of how many police resources are on duty at any given time and projected out for a period of time. So if we found ourselves having to plan something, that integration is able to respond and react much more quickly, efficiently, effectively, and we do manage what's called the Provincial Operations Centre, which would make good common sense to house that type of information as to the resources that are available and accessible.",11-134-16,134,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

11-135-06,"Okay. Looking at Ottawa and what happened in Ottawa, you told us, and we've seen emails that you offered whatever support was necessary. Whatever you need, Chief Sloly, OPS, it's yours. We've also heard, again, from witnesses who have testified, that -- and you’ve said this yourself, that it wasn’t -- it’s not possible or it’s not advisable or feasible to send resources without -- in the absence of a plan. And so -- and I know we’ve touched on this, but I just want to -- I want to put this to you, that there’s sort of a contradiction there, that, you know, “we will do anything we can to help you” versus “we really need to see a plan from you before I send one more OPP officer to Ottawa”. Can you help us understand it, you know, why that’s not a contradiction, if it’s not a contradiction?",11-135-08,135,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU (Cont'd),MR.

11-135-21,"Yeah, I think it’s a really good question. And on the surface, it may appear to be a contradiction, but I think to be -- to be fair to the proceedings, that contradiction is mitigated by actually looking at the data and the evidence. Look at the number of officers that were deployed on each and every day at various intervals. Look at the requests that were made and how they were responded to. And it’s only till we get to a point in time where we need to be able to manage the availability of those police resources for a protracted period of time across the province and manage all of the logistics that are associated to that that there needs to be a more defined plan. So I don’t think they’re contradictory in any way. There’s a point in time where we hit a threshold where it’s just not possible to provide 1,700 police officers and 100 civilians. On any -- on any given day, as I’ve mentioned, we may have a little over 1,000 working with the OPP and we’re managing on a daily basis, on average, approximately 3,400 calls for service, 20 percent of which are what we call priority zero or priority one, so those are emergency 911 calls that warrant an immediate response. To manage all of that across 330 municipalities and a critical event, you need to have a plan. And in the absence of me being satisfied that there is a plan to deploy those resources, I and every police leader would be negligent in their duties.",11-135-23,135,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

11-137-03,"I think you’d have to ask Windsor Police that. I think they felt -- they felt prepared to respond to the intelligence that they had before them. I think you would have to ask them what prevented them from being able to mitigate the blockade. It’s a very tenuous situation. We have to allow the environment for lawful protest, so you know, it sounds easy -- it sounds easy to those that may be listening to the police evidence to say there’s a clear demarcation and delineation between lawful assembly and criminal activity, and it’s not always that case. So although there may be rhetoric, there may be very good intelligence that some parties are planning on participating in what we would describe as an unlawful protest, we have a responsibility to facilitate lawful assembly under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. So how do you find that demarcation? It’s not the difference between saying on this side of the road is long distance and on that side it’s not when we had old telephone networks. It is extremely difficult to decide in some cases at what point this is going to become unlawful assembly and how do you prevent that in that moment of time. Sometimes you cannot prevent it. When presented with it, I think the important question is, how do you de- escalate it. And that’s where the framework, the national framework that this Commission has spent some considerable time hearing about, I think that’s really where the focus needs to be. How do you leverage that framework that once you find yourself in that situation that you can de-escalate? And if you do have to move to enforcement, how can you do that in the most efficient, effective and primarily the safest way to those that are involved in the protests, to the officers and to the community?

11-316-25,"--- for towing? That was definitely discussed. There were a number of things that I asked for that could not be supported by the Legal Team, and we did have discussion around compelling service providers, but the results of those discussions did not bear out in terms of tools that were made available to us.",11-316-26,316,26,25,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

11-317-06,"Yeah, there was lots of discussion that happened in my absence, and the decision -- it did not appear in the Act, so I can't honestly say why it did not or to what extent that was considered. There was lots of discussion around it, lots of ideas proposed, and then we were grateful to receive the legislation when we did.",11-317-07,317,7,6,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

11-317-15,"Yeah, there was no written request, Commissioner, so this was done through a series of meetings and discussions. So I wouldn't want to honestly say how far that discussion went, but that was certainly on the table and something that had been discussed and we had talked about a situation whereby we did have trouble getting a tow truck to lend assistance when there was a blockade that had emerged in and around the Peace Bridge and we had a challenge getting tow trucks to provide the necessary assistance. So these types of things were discussed but I can’t say to what extent given that it wasn’t a written submission; it was merely discussions where I had an opportunity to provide some input.",11-317-16,317,16,15,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

11-318-05,"Now, we also had some evidence you gave about exclusion zones and common-law power about exclusions, and in fact there were powers given, certainly, about the Ambassador Bridge and Interprovincial Bridges under EMPCA, as I understand it; that’s correct?",11-318-06,318,6,5,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

11-318-14,I can’t say that specific locations were discussed in and around Wellington. It was more the categorization of critical infrastructure. So I can’t say that Wellington was discussed specifically.,11-318-15,318,15,14,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,COMM. THOMAS CARRIQUE,comm. thomas carrique
11-318-18,Was your understanding from the EMCPA and the legislation that followed that you could create and exclusion zone around Wellington under that emergency legislation?,11-318-19,318,19,18,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,COMMISSIONER ROULEAU,commissioner rouleau
11-318-22,"My understanding was that the officers could have exercised the authorities contained within to use those enforcement tools, which wouldn’t have been the same as communicating an exclusion zone as define under the Emergencies Act. But if they were asked to disperse from the area of critical infrastructure, the officers had the tools to proceed with charges or seize vehicles, licences, permits under the EMPCA. So that was a tool that was available to officers in Ottawa in and on Wellington.",11-318-23,318,23,22,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,COMM. THOMAS CARRIQUE,comm. thomas carrique

11-319-05,"Critical infrastructure. So I don’t have the legislation in front of me but I believe that that would have fallen into the definitions of the types of locations that would be covered by the EMCPA. If it’s helpful, the OPP did do up a chart that explained to the officers where we felt the various powers would apply. It became very complex for officers to try to navigate their way through these new powers that they weren’t used to in real time, so it may be very helpful to walk through that chart at some point.",11-319-06,319,6,5,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

11-319-14,"So, just to be clear, your understanding is Wellington was declared to be critical infrastructure like the bridges and so on?",11-319-15,319,15,14,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,COMMISSIONER ROULEAU,commissioner rouleau
11-319-17,"Yeah, so I think I can be much clearer. So contained in the EMCPA was the “not to block any highway”. So the definition of a “highway” would include any roadway, so that would include Wellington. So highways were deemed critical infrastructure which addresses the concern on Wellington out in front of the Parliament Buildings. So the roadway itself is deemed to be critical infrastructure.",11-319-18,319,18,17,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,COMM. THOMAS CARRIQUE,comm. thomas carrique
11-319-24,"So blocking any roadway would be critical infrastructure, then, under the Act?",11-319-25,319,25,24,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,COMMISSIONER ROULEAU,commissioner rouleau
11-319-26,"Yes, at that point in time. And as time went on, those authorities were narrowed to a much narrower scope to be specific to borders. But at that point in time, it was blocking access to any highway, as I understand it.",11-319-27,319,27,26,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,COMM. THOMAS CARRIQUE,comm. thomas carrique
11-320-03,"So it would be -- it would -- I guess you’re explaining that that declaration prevented blocking any roadway in Ontario.

As I understand, we’re starting with Former Chief Sloly tomorrow and his evidence will be in-chief tomorrow. It’s scheduled to take the day. In the unusual circumstances where he will go over to the next day, I’ve been asked whether there is any difficulty with his counsel speaking to him over the weekend before he enters cross-examination and I just wanted to see if there were any issues being raised by counsel. It seems to me reasonable under the circumstance but if there’s any objection, I’d like to hear it. If not, then I will be giving that leave given the circumstances. Seeing no objection, we will rise and will reconvene tomorrow at 9:30.",11-320-19,320,19,18,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,COMMISSIONER ROULEAU,commissioner rouleau

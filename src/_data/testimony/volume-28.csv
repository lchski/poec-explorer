So my paramount responsibility is to ensure that we maintain public safety, and the only way that you can do that is to ensure that laws are upheld. But beyond that, and specifically in the context of this Inquiry and in response to the events of last winter, I had a number of responsibilities, including receiving information and sharing information from law enforcement to colleagues within the federal government; making sure that we were staying in touch and engaging with different levels of government, both provincially and municipally; making sure that we gave advice to the government with regards to the decision to invoke the Emergencies Act and then subsequently to revoke the Emergencies Act; being a communicator on behalf of the government to Canadians to keep them apprised of the situation last winter.

So Mr. Clerk, can I ask you to pull up SSM.NSC.CAN.00001790? So Minister Mendicino, to situate you, this is just on January 26th, I believe -- oh, I’m sorry; if you just scroll down a little bit -- you had asked Commissioner Lucki, I believe, to brief you on the convoy.

28-010-05,"I do recall that.

So these -- to situate you again as the document’s being pulled up, Minister -- are talking points for the briefing on January 26th. I believe they’re Commissioner Lucki’s talking points, so they’re not yours, but I’m going to take you through them, and you can confirm to us whether this was the sort of information that was being provided to you that day. So 26th, before the convoy arrives. Scroll down, Mr. Clerk, to where you see, “The goal”; there we go. So: “The goal of the nation wide protest is to disrupt traffic flow and general business of government in the [hope] that the Canadian government will lift all COVID-19 related [restriction].” Below that: “Although the majority of information indicates organizers are planning a peaceful event, many social media posts suggest some participants may attempt to disrupt government buildings and further cause disruptions throughout the city.” Was that information conveyed to you?",28-010-12,10,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Scrolling down again to page 2, please. “It is unknown how long the protesters plan to stay in Ottawa; however the RCMP has located social media posts indicating some participants may stay around the downtown core until January 31st in hopes to disrupt the House of Common’s [sic] sitting that day.” So was that information conveyed to you; and, more broadly, can you tell us what your expectation was before the convoy arrived about how long it would or might stay?",28-011-12,11,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-011-22,"That information was conveyed to me and a number of other colleagues at Cabinet level. And my immediate reaction was to question the quality of the intelligence about the duration with which this protest was going to occur. One of the things that struck me was that there were reported -- reports about a significant number of vehicles that were coming from across the country, and it certainly seemed to me that just given the amount of time that it would take to Ottawa and other locations in the country where these demonstrations would occur, that there may very well be an intention to stay longer than the short period of time that some of those initial briefings had suggested that they would stay there. Combined with some of the public statements around the original manifesto, which in my opinion was the spark for the so-called Freedom Convoy, and the stated political and ideological objectives within that, a document to force the government to reverse course on pandemic policies or else to see the government overthrown or resign suggested to me that there may be an entrenchment. And as time went on, we certainly started to probe those questions more once they arrived at the end of January.",28-011-24,11,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MINISTER MARCO MENDICINO,minister marco mendicino
28-012-17,"Okay. So just to sum that up and to make sure I have it right; when you say question the intelligence, you sort of -- do you mean question the assessment and then the conclusion that this is likely going to be gone by the end of the weekend, and you were concerned that it would stay longer than that?",28-012-19,12,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-012-24,"Okay. Scrolling down to page 3, please, Mr. Clerk, we see -- there we go. Perfect. “With respect to the threat picture, there has been an increase in online narratives supportive of the convoy among both ideologically motivated networks,…” We’ve heard a lot about ideologically motivated networks and IMVE over the past week or so. “…as well as in general public discourse.” And then scrolling down a little bit more: “The convoy is attracting individuals who are not aligned with any specific ideology or group, but who have experienced personal hardships (such as job loss) due to COVID-19 and are upset with provincial or federal government responses as COVID[…] continues to impact daily life. Open Source monitoring has identified associated posts advocating violence and there is potential for anti-government groups to join the demo with violent intentions.” Then it talks about online posts feeding: “…the conspiracy narrative with misinformation and disinformation[, raising tensions]…” Scrolling down a little bit more, please, Mr. Clerk. “Open Source reports also suggest police are setting up roadblocks […] and such reports seem to fuel [no pun intended] some trucker’s agitation. A post to event Facebook group asks for known MP’s addresses in Ottawa including the [PM’s] residence and cottage. [This suggests that] the convoy should break apart to […] these locations.” Is that all information that was conveyed to you?",28-012-26,12,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-014-11,"--- briefly? Because you touched on a few important points. And if I could just ask for the technicians to scroll back up? So right under the words “On January 22[nd], 2022…” there’s a number of bullet points that I just want to shed some additional light on. So the fact that the convoy was attracting individuals with different grievances was one of the phenomenon around the expressly stated ideological, political, and in some cases, extreme stated objectives of the Freedom Convoy. And this was something that, again, was a recurring theme in our discussions with law enforcement, with the security and intelligence community, the fact that it was pulling in people with different grievances, not just in relationship to the pandemic, but grievances regarding the government and other democratic institutions. Similarly, the potential for violence was stated at the outset. I mean, there was a number of very public statements by individuals like Pat King who had said that this could end in bullets or that it would end in bullets potentially, was a single of intent, at least that was my opinion, that certainly not all, I mean there were many thousands of Canadians who participated in these demonstrations and in the blockade who were there for entirely legitimate and lawful purposes, but some were prepared to become violent. There’s a bullet point there about threats to public figures. We were concerned about whether or not the blockade might target the Prime Minister. And then as you will have heard by now, there were subsequent many threats that were made towards not only public -- elected public figures, but equally law enforcement and representatives of the media, which to me, again, signalled that this was a movement that in some cases was prepared to attack our democratic institutions to force change around policies.",28-014-13,14,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MINISTER MARCO MENDICINO,minister marco mendicino
28-015-17,"Okay. I’ll just stop you there. And scroll down to the next page, please, Mr. Clerk, because I think this is -- or actually, I think it’s page 6. This is touching on the point that you just made, Minister Mendicino. So at the top of that page, it says: “Effective January 11 [something] for announcements and public functions has been put in place for eight individuals…” And it lists off Ministers Joly, Freeland, yourself, other Ministers, and Dr. Tam. And without, obviously, getting into what’s behind that section 37 redaction, is it fair to assume that that means that some sort of -- it was a security risk identified?",28-015-19,15,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-016-05,"That’s exactly correct. And the RCMP had briefed in the early days of the convoy, certainly within the first week, that there needed to be a significant change in the security posture regarding the Ministers that are in that paragraph. And in part, I think that was a response to the heightened degree of posts that were violent in nature, the overtly criminal threats that were being made against the lives and the security and safety of identifiable public figures. And so as a result of that, the security detail did change around a number of both me and my colleagues in Cabinet.",28-016-07,16,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MINISTER MARCO MENDICINO,minister marco mendicino
28-016-16,"Okay. And last point on this, if we just scroll down a little bit more, you’ll see a line that says “Concerns from Minister Leblanc” specifically. We’ll be hearing from Minister Leblanc early -- later on today, but it says: “Minister Leblanc has reached in to Minister Mendicino, noting MPs are concerned for their safety amid reporting of demonstrators attending their residences. This is being taken into consideration as part of the above planning for deployment of resources.”",28-016-18,16,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-016-28,"And I think that that is worth emphasizing as well, because in addition to the security that was provided to Ministers and Cabinet, there was a heightened security posture around the Hill and around being able to access Parliament. And indeed, one of my main concerns was that given, again, some of the stated objectives by some, including the potential to become violent, that we were just returning from winter session, and the first day of the resumption of Parliament coincided with one of the early days in the blockade and subsequent occupation right here in Ottawa. And I was worried about a significant number of people being able to both ingress and egress from the Hill. And so there was a heightened security posture so that we could continue to host Parliament, or to hold Parliament. It was a very important priority that Canadians see that the business of government continue, not withstanding the blockade and the convoy. But there were challenges. And I had many conversations with Parliamentarians, disproportionality women, I would point out, who were the recipient of harassment, intimidation, expressions of hate, through the convoy. So that additional security was very much driven by the reality on the ground.",28-016-30,16,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MINISTER MARCO MENDICINO,minister marco mendicino
28-017-24,"Okay. That was actually my next question, whether these concerns were based on identified threats having been identified, I’m going to use that word twice, but by the intelligence services, or by law enforcement, or whether these were based on what was being seen on social media or based on, essentially, complaints or worries expressed by Members of Parliament and the individuals involved?",28-017-26,17,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-018-03,"All of the above. So it was a combination of what we were seeing on the ground in the activities of the convoy, and probably the most aggressive demonstration of their presence was the parking of, ultimately, hundreds of trucks on Wellington Street, which is one of the main arteries that runs through the Parliamentary Precinct. And again, I’ll just pause here. I mean, that visual suggested to me that we were going to be in it for quite some time, rather than just the weekend. But I’ll come back to that. We were -- I’m sure that the RCMP were taking into account what they were seeing online, what they were hearing from various Parliamentarians regarding potential security threats, and so for all those reasons, again, security was elevated not only for Cabinet, but for Parliamentarians and for staff who were working in the Parliamentary Precinct.",28-018-05,18,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-018-19,"Okay. And we will get to the actual arrival of the convoy, but there’s one more document I’d like to pull up before we get there. So Mr. Clerk, that is SSM.NSC.CAN.00001809. And so this, Minister, may go to what you were just expressing about your heightened level of concern. This is Friday, January 28th at around noon. So this is as the convoy would be starting to roll in. You send an email to Mike Jones. Can you tell us who Mike Jones is? Because his name will come up a few times, I think, this morning.",28-018-21,18,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-019-01,"Mike Jones is my Chief of Staff. And the email that you had put up, which is dated Friday, January 28th, at about 5:38 p.m. reflects the questions that I intend to put to the table. So looking at latest estimate on numbers, both in terms of vehicles and people, trying to ascertain whether or not there was any intelligence of individuals who may be on a watch list regarding threats to national security. The third question that I put in the email there, which is written as “latest on what if scenarios”, what I was really, I think, foreshadowing, was a discussion around potential contingencies. Like what if the convoy doesn’t disengage? What if they don’t leave? And from a very early point, as I had said earlier, had concerns that this was not just going to be a one or a two-day event, that it was going to last much longer. And so I wanted to extract from the community, the law enforcement community, the intelligence community what do we do if that’s the case, how do we make sure that we keep public safety and what are the contingencies around that.",28-019-03,19,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-019-27,"And as you say, you’re asking what if scenarios, what if they don’t leave, what if it lasts beyond Monday, what if it turns violent, what if they come before Parliamentary residences. And we know now at this point that what ended up happening as of, I think, January 28 was a group of Ministers consisting of yourself, I believe Minister Leblanc, Minister Blair and Minister Alghabra were briefed daily by a variety of officials from PCO and various agencies under Public Safety. Would that have been done in response to this request?",28-019-29,19,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-020-10,"I think it was understood early on that we were going to need to take a whole of government approach responding to the convoy, so the initial group that you just highlighted of Ministers was eventually expanded and then ultimately, as I’m sure we’ll get into, the Prime Minister convened a meeting of the Incident Respondent Group which included a number of others. But I should highlight the two last points which are in the email to Mike Jones, which suggests that, at the time, I was also concerned about making sure that we were staying up on threat assessments as well to Senators as well as the Governor General in addition to elected Parliamentarians. And finally, I wanted to get a sense of what outreach was being done to the organizers. And my thinking there was let’s try to allow for the space for a lawful protest, keep it within the boundaries of the law because it is a hallmark of our democracy that people can take opposing different views. And so wanted to make sure that there was come lines of communication with the organizers of the convoy from the early days.",28-020-12,20,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-022-05,"My recollection is that he was out of Ottawa for some period of time and then would be returning to Ottawa and to ultimately the House of Commons. And so I was -- I was outlining my concern about his ability to -- for him and his staff and the RCMP that work with him to protect him to get into and out of Parliament safely because by then -- and the date of this text is Sunday, February the 6th, so we’re fully now, I think, about a week into the convoy. And this would have been after the first weekend. And the concerns that I was expressing was that by that first weekend, it was my opinion that it was virtually impossible to enforce the law on Wellington Street. Given the rampant behaviour, not only the noise that was being made by the excessive honking of horns well into the evening, but some of the early reports -- and again, this -- bear in mind, this is Sunday, February 6th. By then there were a number of press conferences that the Ottawa Police Service had held expressing serious concerns around the reports of intimidation, harassment and violence. If memory serves, I think there was a press conference where the Ottawa Police Service had indicated that there were reports of firearms that had been brought into the nation’s capital and subsequently -- again, I’m going from memory, but there was at least one arrest that was reported of somebody that was making their way potentially to the convoy where a firearm was seized. You know, there were efforts, I think, by law enforcement to try and get the situation under control, but they were overwhelmed. So there were a series of events leading up to the text that Mike Jones had sent to Brian Clow that had -- that had led to my concerns being elevated about our ability to restore public safety on Wellington Street in the nation’s capital, which is the seat of the federal government. I would also just add that my concerns were not just about Ottawa, that by then there were already reports as well about borders being blockaded. And I would just recall for you and for Judge Rouleau that, in my job as Minister of Public Safety, I’m not just looking at the nation’s capital or the Parliamentary precinct; I’m looking at the entire country. And so by then, a number of critical infrastructure and borders had become either the target of or, in fact, blockades which had a significant impact on critical supply chains. So there was a lot that was, I think -- I’m interpreting and extracting a little bit exactly from the language, but I think that’s what Mike Jones was conveying to Brian Clow.",28-022-07,22,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And if they aren’t going to do it then we may need to look at other measures. Let me know if you want to discuss.” So this represents where your thinking is, as you say, at the end of the first week.

So you mentioned, Minister Mendicino, that at this point there had been a number of requests made from the Ottawa Police and various provinces at this point, even. There’d been an approach from Alberta, but we’re not really getting into Alberta right now. But in any event, around the 7th or 8th of February, a decision was made that it would be a good idea to convene the federal, provincial and municipal governments to discuss the situation in Ottawa and the way forward from there, including the provision of resources, as you mentioned. There are a lot of issues to cover that come out of the tripartite, so we’re going to focus on a few. A few of those issues are the RCMP resources, it’s the lack of the OPS plan, and there is what seems to be expressed as a lack of engagement from the Province of Ontario.

He pronounced very definitively and declaratively that it was time for people to go home. If I recall correctly, that would've been before this tripartite. There were other conversations that I was having bilaterally around the tripartite.

28-029-09,"Well, that's a very important question because the principle of operational independence has to guide the relationship between police and the elected branch of government. And again, from my past professional experience as a prosecutor and as a practicing lawyer, I would have been very familiar, precisely because I had worked closely with police in a variety of different cases and the need to respect that principle at all times. So I wanted to be sure that even as though we were asking questions of police to provide some detail and some clarity around how they intended to restore public safety, that at all times it was respectful of that principle. At the same time, I do think it bears emphasising that police and the elected branch of government do not operate in two silos, and nor should we. That there needs to be a dialogue between both branches to be sure that police have the resources that they need, which was one of my core responsibilities in the response to the blockade, as well as potentially additional tools to respond to the unique and unprecedented nature of this convoy, which is something that we ultimately came to. So I know you may have more questions about operational independence, but I wanted to flag really early on that, you know, as we were asking questions we were mindful of that. The other thing I would just stress if I could is that in ultimately forming the opinion that we needed to invoke the Emergencies Act, one of my main concerns was the inability to enforce the law adjacent to critical infrastructure, and that would've included Parliament. And the nature of the Parliamentary Precinct is such that Wellington Street falls within the jurisdiction of the Ottawa Police Service. So I was certainly trying to reconcile in my mind that these are federal democratic institutions, but we did not have total jurisdiction over that space. In other words, it wasn't at the sole or exclusive discretion of the RCMP, which is the federal police service, to go and assert itself on Wellington Street to bring the situation back into control. So we had to navigate different levels of government, including municipal and provincial, because Ottawa Police Service has that jurisdiction as of this moment, and if they did not have the resources to respond to the occupation at that point, including the ability to remove hundreds of large vehicles on Wellington Street; including the ability to remove a crane, which had been parked right adjacent to the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office; including the ability to simply enforce the law, then they could then next go to -- they then, statutorily, under the Ontario Police Services Act, could go to the Ontario Government to ask for the Ontario Provincial Police Service to backstop any gaps there. But I would point out that there is no statutory link beyond that to go from the Ontario Police Services Act to the Emergencies Act, and I know that's something we're to come to.",28-029-11,29,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

We saw that in Coventry.” So he’s discussing there the give and take or the reactions and counterreactions in Ottawa, specifically. But he then says: “Our public request for more -- for...1800 more people resulted in the activity in Windsor, plus a national call for protesters to drive to Ottawa so they can outnumber even increased police presence.

28-035-04,"That is a critically important intervention by Chief Sloly at the time, for a couple of reasons. First, he’s flagging as a very serious concern that locally they are outnumbered. And he says that it is exceeding their -- or he suggests that it is very close to exceeding their current resources, which is why they had asked for some additional help, including from the RCMP, which by then we would have responded to. There were a couple of installations prior to the invocation of the Act that I think numbered in the hundreds; somewhere between, you know, 200 at the outset and then eventually getting up to about 500 all told. There were questions about exactly how those resources were being deployed by the RCMP in conjunction with Ottawa Police Service, but the real important point is he’s saying, “We’re outnumbered, and we need help.” That’s what I took from that intervention. The other thing that he mentioned in that intervention is Coventry. And through a number of briefings in the leadup to the invocation of the Emergencies Act there was a discussion of two different groups that were at play in the blockades. There was a large group, again, of Canadians who were exercising their lawful right to protest against certain policies by the government, but then there was another group that had other, more extreme objectives that was much more sophisticated and organized. And it’s my recollection that that latter group was interspersed in a number of different locations very tactically but that there was a concentration of that latter group at Coventry Road that was made up, potentially, of individuals who had previously served in either the military or in law enforcement. And that, to me, raised a concern, a very serious concern about some of the counteroperations that could be run by that group to overwhelm legitimate law enforcement. And that, I think, is exactly what Chief Sloly is getting at when -- you know, if numbers are being reported publicly about how many additional reinforcements are being sent in, then the word could go out to call for more protesters to descend into the nation’s capital or, you know, again, quite frankly, to deploy across the country. And again, I would hasten to add, this was not just about Ottawa; this was about the entire country where we would see the levels of protest go up and go down. And the time that I thought was most dangerous were typically the weekends, and that’s when there was a surge of people who came and descended into the Parliamentary precinct and that -- if I read Chief Sloly right -- was in part a tactical decision that was being informed by some within the group who had the skills and the experience to overwhelm whatever police resources were available at the time.",28-035-06,35,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Let’s get you the additional boots on the ground.” And in dialogue with the Commissioner of the RCMP, we were responsive to that request on more than one occasion, deploying additional RCMP members to assist to restore public safety here in the nation’s capital.

They were not -- you know, they were not necessarily subject to the Ontario Provincial Police responding at the time. I wanted to be as supportive as I could. I was very much sympathetic to the plight of the residents in Ottawa; I was very concerned for their safety and security, and we were beginning to see counterprotests manifesting because I think at that time, residents felt that they had to take matters into their own hands. That was extremely concerning to me because I thought that it represented a significant risk of more serious violence as a result of frustration and fatigue, and we were seeing an abundance of expressions of that in reporting and on social media. So I wanted to be as supportive as I could to the City of Ottawa and to the Ottawa Police Service, and Chief Sloly, I think rightfully, was flagging his concerns about a resource capacity and potential counteroperations that were being run by the blockade and the occupation.",28-037-24,37,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And the initial responses of law enforcement to get the situation back under control were clearly overwhelmed, and as a result of that, the consequences were devastating to people, to the economy, to our international relations. And so at all times, I was assessing, not any one of these events in isolation, but rather, the situation in its totality. And when looking at the timing of it and the concurrence of all of these events in the same short critical period of time, the types of targets where the individuals were showing up for the express purposes of creating a disruption and undermining public safety, and the type of tactics that were being used, which was through sheer size and force of people, of vehicles, and behaviour, that this was a very singular and unprecedented event.

There were reports about there being threats being made to them as they tried to do their job. And they were clearly identifiable, in uniform, you know, indicating that, you know, it was time to go home. And these were not just interactions. I mean, they ultimately did lead to hundreds of criminal charges being laid, including assaulting a police officer, which is a very serious offence to be charged with. This was all a counter reaction to the reaction of law enforcement to try and restore public safety on the ground, and it wasn't just in Ottawa. It was at ports of entry in -- at the Pacific Highway, in Surrey in British Columbia, where again, there were very clear statements by Canada Border Service agents as well as local law enforcement there through the RCMP, that it was time to go home. And in the face of those instructions, not only did numbers -- participants double down, I mean there is a very notorious incident involving a large vehicle that was painted with military fatigues that tried to crash a barrier. To me, that poses a serious threat of violence. And I think we'll come to Coutts, Alberta, which was, again, a very, and arguably the most egregious risk that coincided with the blockade.

And by then the blockade was causing significant interruption to the economy and thousands of people were temporarily laid off, businesses were impacted in the auto manufacturing sector. So I think he's trying to get -- gain some understanding from the Attorney General of Ontario about perhaps what advice he is offering to the Ontario government. Again, I'm drawing some inferences here, but I think it's a combination of that, but I think more broadly, just to keep lines of communication strong between the Federal Government and the Government of Ontario.",28-043-19,43,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So Ms. Astravas says: “Hey so on trilateral meeting Sam I don’t know what you think but I really think we need Jones at the table […] perhaps your boss […] push again” So Mike Jones, he’s talking about you. He says: “By Jones I assume you mean [Ontario], and can have my boss reach out again but the last call got pretty frosty at the end when he was saying we need the province to get back to us with their plan ‘I don’t take edicts from you, you’re not my fucking boss’” Scroll down again. “Yes!

28-047-18,"There was definitely some colourful vernacular towards the end of that call. I’m happy to say that both Minister Jones and I still enjoy a very productive and positive rapport. But the real thrust of the call was to engage Minister Jones to understand exactly where her thinking and where the Government of Ontario’s thinking was at in responding to the request of Ottawa Police Service to get additional resources, and more broadly speaking, to restore public safety on the ground. And you know, I think certainly by the end of the call, it was quite clear that the inability of law enforcement using existing authorities to restore public safety on the ground was of increasing concern to me in my capacity as the Minister of Public Safety, as well as the Federal Government, and we wanted to be sure that Ontario was exercising all of its capacity to support not only Ottawa, but other communities as well in this province, including Windsor. So it was an important engagement. It was obviously a very stressful time and, you know, I think that we could all be forgiven for some rather blunt language. I’m sure, you know, we’ve all heard it in various interactions.

So we can take that document down, please, and we’ll pull up the read out of your call from Premier Ford, which is SSM.CAN.NSC00002832. How did that call arise? Did you call Premier Ford?

28-048-25,"The Premier called me, and by then, again, it’s important to place the timing and the chronology of this call into the broader context. This would have been February 9th, so we’re now beyond a week in to the occupation here in the Nation’s capital and with significant interruptions at critical infrastructure and borders, including at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, at the Windsor/Detroit border, which quite clearly is in the Province of Ontario. The Premier called me to I think express a few things, and the read out is there on the screen. But one, I think he was calling to keep lines of communication open with the Federal Government. Two, he was indicating to me that his Chief Public Health Officer was going to be going out in the very short term to communicate the end of vaccine passports and the end of mandates. But he also was very supportive and said that he was prepared to stand with the Prime Minister, which I took as, again, a very constructive suggestion to show unity across different levels of government responding to what was then a very urgent state of crisis and emergency, and having that demonstration of solidarity I thought would reinsure Ontarians and Canadians. I also did say to him that I would relay what I interpreted to be a bit of a nudge by Premier Ford around the Federal Government’s posture around pandemic policy to the Prime Minister, more broadly just the fact that the call had occurred. And I did take the opportunity to express to him two really important things. You know, first, I was really concerned about restoring public safety at critical infrastructure, including the Ambassador Bridge, and, you know, I also said I was concerned that even if there was an announcement around a change in pandemic policy, that they may not leave. I think in the end, that proved to be true. And then finally, I said that we needed Sylvia, and there I’m referring to Minister Jones at the table and I’m referring to the tripartite table, and I ask that the Premier instruct her to be there.",28-048-27,48,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

It says: “Just got call from Ford. They’re pivoting. He will announce they’re lifting passports, possibly more measures. Said he would stand with the PMs.” (As read) And then you said: “Said I would relay. I said the situation at Ambassador Bridge is serious.

28-051-04,"My interpretation from Premier Ford saying that to me directly was that he wanted to show solidarity with the Federal Government in responding to this emergency. And I thought that that was a constructive suggestion, because it would reassure Ontarians and Canadians more broadly that different levels of government were working together to restore public safety to keep people safe, which was my job. And my request to him to have Minister Jones attend the tripartite was an effort to show that alignment at all levels of government, not only from Premier to the Prime Minister, but equally from -- at the Ministerial level in the portfolio of Public Safety, because by being at the same table at the same time, we could really troubleshoot issues together, including, again, some of the operational challenges that police were having, again not only in Ottawa, but right across the province, and equally, some of the jurisdictional complexities, and whether or not there were any other measures or tools that we could offer from the elected side of the government to police if it were necessary.",28-051-06,51,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-052-12,"Okay. The last point I want to ask you about on all of this is to get your reaction to something we heard from Mr. Mario Di Tommaso when he testified, which was -- and I'll paraphrase what he was saying, but essentially, part of his thinking or his explanation of why Ontario was reluctant to participate in the tripartites is that insofar as these were a forum to discuss policing resources, Ontario -- the governmental officials shouldn't participate in that because that's a law enforcement matter. The question of deploying police resources is something for law enforcement, not for governmental officials. What's your take on that in the context of what we'd raised earlier about the lines of operational dependence of the police?",28-052-14,52,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-052-25,"Yeah, here again, this is a very important question. First, I can't speak for the Deputy Minister of Public Safety or the Solicitor General in Ontario, but from where I sat, the Premier of Ontario actually showed very important leadership in the early days of the blockade, going out publicly saying that this had no longer -- was a lawful protest and that people needed to go home. And that was a signal, I think, to any fair-minded individual who abides by the law that the situation was no longer safe. I would also point out that, you know, in the context of the discussion around operational independence, and I've obviously given this a fair bit of reflection since the occupation, and I did touch on it a little bit earlier, that there are important boundaries that should not be crossed by elected officials, and for good reason. We do want to safeguard against the politicization or making partisan important and independent decisions, which are made by law enforcement and the prosecution services around the country, so that we can preserve the integrity of the administration of justice. And at all times, we adhere to that principle in the federal government. That having been said, there does need to be a dialogue and there is a dialogue between police and the elected branch of government when it comes to providing additional resources and tools. And I can offer a number of, you know, very concrete examples, not only in the general, but in the specific context of our response to the blockade. So if I could, when I received a call at the beginning of February from the Premier of Alberta, the then Premier of Alberta Jason Kenney, one of the concerns that he'd expressed is that he and Alberta did not possess either the resources or the tools to clear the blockade at Coutts, which had mobilized pretty much since the end of January or beginning of February. And as part of the federal government's response to that situation, I authorized, under Article 9.3 of the existing Police Services Agreement between Canada and Albert, the deployment of additional police resources. That is a very concrete example of how we have customized through convention the relationship between the elected government and the authorities that are exercised through this office, the Minister of Public Safety, in response to the operational decisions that are taken by police to restore public safety. I would say more broadly, there, you know, are other important examples where elected representatives that occupy this office are responsive to the needs of police around tools. You know, be it in, you know, responding to either this situation or others, and obviously, there are the priorities around the foreign deployment of RCMP in different countries, for example, in Ukraine, which are priorities which can be set by the elected branch of government where conventional police forces are deployed. So I guess my broader point is that both in the specific context of the blockade, but even beyond in the general, there does need to be a dialogue, and there was a dialogue between the elected branch of government and the police who were exercising operational independence at every time to ensure that we could get them the additional resources that they need in the parts of the country where they needed it. And again, I emphasize and stress, this was not just an isolated incident, that these events were occurring across the country, so that we could restore public safety.",28-052-27,52,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

One of them is that -- I believe Commissioner Lucki said that there were times, or I think it was Deputy Commissioner Duheme said that there were times where it may have felt to him like officials may have stepped a little over that line, that line between church and state. Now I think they did say specifically, I remember -- I recall Commissioner Lucki saying that she never felt pressured by her Ministers, you and Minister Blair. She did say that at some point you sort of had to educate her or educated -- she didn't point to any sort of instance where it was necessary, but she said you educated and it felt you essentially to educate the rest of Cabinet, I think, or it was the February 10th IRG ---",28-055-03,55,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-055-21,"I do, and I wanted to be sure that as colleagues around the Cabinet table were expressing the same concerns that I had, that others had about the ineffectiveness of existing authorities and resources to restore public safety up to that point, and we are approaching now two weeks into the blockade, that nevertheless, we should not violate the principle of operational independence. Because, again, just situate yourself in our shoes for just a moment. Our paramount concern is restoring public safety. And by then, there were countless reports of the very dire consequences that had been visited upon Canadians. But that could never be a license for assuming the roles and the responsibilities of police when it came to making the tactical and operational decisions around how to restore public safety. So it was important to strike a balance between respecting that principle, but also, fulfilling our -- my role specifically in holding the RCMP accountable for their role in restoring public safety and more broadly, the government's role in understanding why it was that despite existing authorities and resources, we could not achieve the goal of getting a law and order back on the ground. And when I look back now and, you know, I ask myself, you know, why it was in the perception of the Commissioner that she felt that some, not all, were coming up to the line, it is because of the unique and singular nature of this public order emergency. It was the fact that the scale of this was national. It was the fact that what sparked this movement in the opinion of the government was an expressly stated political objective that at times was expressed in violent terms that led to the entrenchment of a significant number of individuals to ignore the direction of law enforcement at the risk and at the peril of Canadians. It was -- the challenges that we had in government around having the appropriate intelligence tools to understand how those initially stated objectives could pull in people from many different walks of life with different backgrounds and different grievances and coalesce them around something that so significantly and persistently caused significant interruption to public safety, to the economy, to our international relations, and all of that was, I think, part of the reason why people were really trying to probe and understand that despite the fact that you had a Criminal Code, you couldn't use it. Despite the fact that you had provincial statutes around the Highway Traffic Act, they couldn't be effectively used. Despite the fact that we had tow trucks, we had many tow trucks, that they could not be deployed to clear the blockades, and all of that was leading to an escalation of the risk and the threat of serious violence as time went on. And that is why I think that the Commissioner, both signalled her concern, but also, appreciated my intervention that we still had to be respectful of that principle of operational independence.",28-055-23,55,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So -- I mean, I think that is just a natural reaction to all of the events that were occurring. But the reason why I'm confident, and the reason why I believe Commissioner Lucki testified that we didn't violate the principle of operational independence is because at no time were we instructing police on how to do their job on the ground. So at no time were we saying ""You must arrest people under the following provisions of the law."" ""You must prosecute these people, you know, to the fullest extent."" ""You must, you know, to the granularity of detail deploy, you know, five people here and a hundred people there."" And to prioritise all these operations, we at all times steered clear of that zone, which would have been a violation of the principle of operational independence.

28-059-23,"Engagement was always an option. And I had articulated on a number of occasions that law enforcement should be the last resort. And you saw, from one of the exhibits that you had put to me a little bit earlier in my testimony this morning, that I had turned my mind right at the very beginning of the briefings that it was important for there to be some engagement with those who were participating in the convoy and the blockade, and wanted to be briefed on that by law enforcement, who I thought was the most appropriate actor in this context to be engaging with, given that, you know, in my estimation, that it was operational and tactical. That didn't mean that I wasn't still having conversations with individuals outside of law enforcement about an engagement proposal, but there was early contemplation and reflection about having an engagement strategy. I would say beyond that, there were conversations between the Prime Minister and myself about searching for a suitable mediator or interlocutor, someone who would have had the experience to de-escalate and resolve situations that are complex. And beyond that, by the time we got to the IRG there was a report that was given by Deputy Minister Stewart about information that he had gleaned from conversations that he was having with the Ontario Government and the OPP around the intelligence of what the group was constituted of in terms of adherence to, you know, ideology, the desire to, you know, double down and hold the line, and et cetera, and all that, versus everybody else who might have just been there to express another point of view. And so as a result of that report that he offered at the IRG, there were taskings that were listed by the Clerk of the Privy Council at the end of that meeting, one of which was to continue to develop a potential engagement strategy. And so that's what the Deputy Minister set about to do, and I know that there, you know, was some additional work on that front.",28-059-25,59,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

We got some very last minute (and thin) paper tonight on an engagement strategy from my DM, who apparently socialized it with PCO, Rcmp [Commissioner] and the Ontario [Government], and not me. We only found out about it during a call tonight I placed to him. The DM's outreach during the day to the [Ontario Government] on this engagement proposal, resulted in the [Ontario] Deputy [Solicitor General] sending my DM a draft letter addressed to unnamed protesters proposing engagement, which would be co-signed by [Ontario government] and an unnamed official from the [Federal Government]. It's unclear whether PCO, RCMP or [Ontario Government] has given their support to the engagement proposal. Flagging as a concern and inconsistent with good info flow.

28-062-12,"I'm expressing a concern that the Deputy Minister had socialised with a different level of government an engagement proposal that I would have wanted to have some input into prior to that. And you know, again, admittedly, in this particular moment everybody is working extremely hard, long hours, trying to quickly fulfill the tasks that had been accomplished, or fulfill the tasks that had been assigned, I beg your pardon, at the end of the last IRG. And so I wanted to be sure that we were together, thinking through, not only the engagement proposal, but also, mitigating and thinking through some of the very real and practical considerations that had to be woven into the strategy if one was going to be deployed. For example, and I posed some of those questions, who are we going to send this to? Where is it going to take place? How can we be sure that if we do engage in it that we can maintain public safety? Because the situation was extremely volatile and very tense, and among the concerns were whether or not there was actually any cohesive structure to the occupation at that moment in time, and so understanding who we were sitting down with was critically important. And so I just was -- I wanted to be sure that Ms. Telford was aware of that, because ultimately, when we go back to Cabinet, I am responsible and accountable for my department, including the Deputy Minister, and wanted to be sure that I was equipped to answer any questions from colleagues about what this engagement proposal would look like. So, you know, I say, again, in fairness to everybody, this was an exceedingly difficult and challenging time, and I know that Deputy Minister Stewart was doing his level best to fulfil a task that had been assigned to him after the IRG and was, I think, trying to action it and get some traction at the Ontario level of government, and we did have a good conversation about that.

28-065-10,"Everything was happening very quickly. There's no doubt about that. The other -- the reason I asked you whether you were concerned about the proposal itself was because one of the bits of evidence we've heard is that Commissioner Lucki and the RCMP may have had some concerns about it or -- about the proposal in the sense that it may have crossed the line between church and state. So, again, we're back to this issue of police independence, operational independence. And I'd like you to speak for a moment, if you could, about how -- the idea -- where does political negotiation fall into that piece. And just for a little -- to situate you in background, what we know now is that there were different lines of potential engagement going on almost simultaneously. There was an attempt at engagement in Windsor. There was an attempt on the part of Mayor Watson to coral trucks up onto Wellington Street and get them off the residential streets where they were disturbing the residents on those streets, and then there was the federal government's engagement proposal. So we have these different lines going at the same time, and that could arguably, at least, be put as something that makes it difficult for law enforcement to do their job. What's your reaction to that?",28-065-12,65,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-066-04,"Yeah, I would agree with you. I think it was extremely difficult for law enforcement to figure out how to engage in a constructive way with the occupation and the blockades, not only here in Ottawa but across the country. I know from the early days that members of Police Liaison Units, these are individuals within law enforcement who have very specific expertise in engaging with people who protest, to sort of set the boundaries of what -- just to be sure that everybody can be safe. So here's what we can all sort of agree to, and I think that there -- as you've heard previously, there was some effort to do that certainly at the local level here in Ottawa. But to come back to what I think that -- like, the core of your question is, you are absolutely right that it becomes a lot trickier and more complex once elected officials start to penetrate into the terms and the conditions by which you negotiate a disengagement of the blockades and the occupation if it involves, let's say, you know, the moving of vehicles, the moving of people, the moving of police officers. All of that, I would submit, is much more within the operational domain, and by extension, independence of police, which was one of the concerns that I had in navigating this appropriately. So that was, I think, part of what I was getting at in my text to Ms. Telford was just I wanted to be able to think that through with everybody, and especially if we were going to be sharing it with other levels of law enforcement so that we were respectful of those principles of operational independence as well.",28-066-06,66,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-067-03,"Okay. I now want to ask you, turning to -- we know the engagement proposal didn't go anywhere in the end. And we're -- chronologically, we're now getting to the crux of events and when the Emergencies Act was actually decided on. So I know it wasn't decided necessarily on the 13th, but that's the day we're going to talk about. There's some evidence, and I'll ask you if you know about this first, so shortly before -- we understand there was an IRG meeting in the afternoon of the 13th, followed by a meeting of the full Cabinet in the evening at 8:30 p.m. The Commission has seen evidence shortly before that 8:30 meeting. Commissioner Lucki sent an email, and let's get the email up. It is SSM.NSC.CAN.00002280. So this is an email, the timestamp on it is just shortly before eight o'clock once we do the Greenwich Mean Time adjustment. This is your Chief of Staff, Mike Jones, sending this to you and copied to Deputy Minister Stewart, ""Evening Minister Responses from the commissioner below."" And this is -- we've seen this already in the inquiry, so I won't go through it at length, but there's a sort of a wish list or these are tools that could be effective. And then at the very bottom of the email -- there -- Commissioner Lucki says, ""This said, I am of the view that we have not yet exhausted all available tools that are already available through the existing legislation. There are instances where charges could be laid under existing authorities for various Criminal Code offences occurring right now in the context of the protest. The Ontario Provincial Emergencies Act just enacted..."" Skip that in the narrative, but we know that happened February 11th. ""...will also help in providing additional deterrent tools to our existing toolbox.""

28-068-16,"I don't recall exactly when I would have seen it. This, as you pointed out, was sent just prior to the commencement of the Cabinet meeting. I will say to you importantly that, a couple things, first, the Commissioner did not express that opinion to me at any time directly. And I actually spoke to the Commissioner earlier that day, on February 13th. And while she did not at all address that last point that you raised in the email, she did call me and only me. This was a conversation between just her and I, to be clear, to express her very grave concerns about the situation in Coutts. And she underlined for me that the situation in Coutts involved a hardened cell of individuals who were armed to the teeth with lethal firearms, who possessed a willingness to go down with the cause. And the reason why this was such a sensitive conversation was that we had RCMP undercover personnel deployed in the field. And she was justifiably concerned that there not be any leak of this information because lives literally hung in the balance. And, for me, this represented, far and away, the most serious and urgent moment in the blockade to this point in time. And so it also spoke volumes to me about the Commissioner’s state of mind, which was that we were potentially seeing an escalation of serious violence with the situation in Coutts. And it certainly, I think, was -- in the broader context of the preponderance of the advice that we were getting from the Commissioner at that time as a result of conversations, not only in the ERGs, about where there were gaps in authorities -- in existing authorities to return public safety to the ground, could not have drawn any other inference that she was supportive, as she later expressed that she was, of the decision to invoke the Emergencies Act. This was a singular moment for me, in my mind. And it was so urgent that I said to her, “Well, look, I can’t just keep this information to myself. At a minimum I have to be able to share it with the Prime Minister,” which I then subsequently took steps to do. Shortly thereafter, I reached out to Ms. Telford ---",28-068-18,68,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MINISTER MARCO MENDICINO,minister marco mendicino

And so I felt I had a responsibility to let, at a minimum, the Prime Minister know, and his staff know, while respecting the operational sensitivity at the most delicate levels to protect the people on the ground. And so I did that. I spoke to Ms. Telford afterwards, where I conveyed to her both the best information that I had at the time around Coutts, and asked her to keep this -- to respect, in effect, the Commissioner’s request that we treat this information with the utmost sensitivity so that we could ensure that we were keeping people safe.

And, again, it was consistent with the advice that we were getting contemporaneous to the decision of the invocation of the Emergencies Act around tools to address the gaps that existed. So, you know, the need to deploy RCMP officers; the need to procure essential services; importantly, the need to declare no-go zones, or prohibition of assemblies. Let me just say on that last point that I wasn’t just hearing about that from the RCMP. The CBSA had briefed Cabinet on, at least a -- one occasion for sure, if not more, about their explicit concerns about the lack of their authority and jurisdiction to clear roads on the way to the border.

28-074-11,"Yes. So I would have been trying to really get a clarity of understanding about what the gaps were. And what the then-President of the CBSA is expressing to me is that they need something that they don’t have. And what they don’t have at this moment in time is any existing authority to turn away foreign nationals who are attempting to enter into Canada where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that they may want to support, what at this point, is an illegal blockade. And so that is, again, a cry, an obvious request for some assistance here as a result of a gap in an authority. And there is a direct line between that gap and the subsequent powers which were included under the Emergencies Act. There’s no other way for me to interpret the information that I’m getting from John Ossowski. It’s certainly not to do anything about it. And subsequently we did provide that authority, and there were, as my understanding recollects, at least, I think, one or two individuals who were turned away on February 19th by CBSA on the strength of the Emergencies Act authorities that were provided to them.",28-074-13,74,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-075-13,"“And we’re concerned that we don’t have the authority that we need.” And this was in addition to what I think is one of the other significant concerns that CBSA expressed to me and to other Cabinet colleagues, which is that they did not have the authority or the jurisdiction to clear the roads leading to the border. And, certainly, that limited their capacity to keep the border open, and by extension, critical supply chains; food, fuel, health supplies; all the like, the people in the border communities. And I’m certainly familiar with the community in Windsor, as a result of some family relationships. But people have got to go about their daily lives, and this was completely impossible at that time. And so, you know, I think he’s expressing two very legitimate gaps. And so again, the only interpretation for me is that we need some help here. And so we endeavour to provide that help to them through the Emergencies Act.",28-075-15,75,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-081-17,"Okay. Welcome back, Minister. I want to take you back to something we were -- we’d touched on before the break and I’d like to get your reaction on. I asked you whether if you had seen and observed, let’s put it that way, Commissioner Lucki’s statement that they had not yet exhausted all available tools? Law enforcement still had tools available. I asked you whether that would have changed your mind as to necessity of the Emergencies Act and you answered no and you explained that your concern about Coutts. How do you reconcile that position with the notion that the Emergencies Act is a measure of last resort?",28-081-18,81,18,17,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY, Continued",MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-081-28,"Well first I would say that the absence of having a direct conversation with Commissioner Lucki, and I pointed out the call that we had earlier today, but that wasn’t the only one. There were other meetings, and IRGs, and daily briefings. Really it was an impediment at that point to have the kind of back and forth exploration of that advice, which she had included in an email to my Chief of Staff, Mike Jones. I think the other thing -- the other reason why I don’t believe it would have substantially changed my views at that point are two-fold. One, it didn’t really expand at all on how she had come to that point of view. So when she talked about a plan, there was no elaboration on it. And I would point out that for the better part of two weeks leading up to February 13th, that there were times where the Commissioner and others at those daily calls that we were having were expressing concerns about the absence of a plan with existing authorities. So at that particular moment in time, it seemed to me, as a conclusory statement that was not substantiated with any kind of particular detail. And the second reason why I don’t believe it would have changed, you know, where my thinking was at that particular moment in time, was predominately because of the call earlier that day, which was top of mind. And as I explained before the morning break, it just -- it spoke volumes about what her state of mind was, which was that this was a potentially an escalation of violence that could result in there being gun violence and potentially serious injuries or even fatalities to members of law enforcement and Canadians. One thing I didn’t mention was that my worry, my real fear, was that had that operation not gone down peacefully, that it might have sparked other gun violence across the country. And I recall early reports from the Ottawa Police Service that guns had been brought into the National Capital Region and into the -- potentially into the Parliamentary Precinct. And there wasn’t a lot of detail around that. I want to be clear. But we were operating with the best information that we had available to us. So that elevated my concerns. And so that’s where my state of mind was, as opposed to the one bullet point that she had sent to my Chief of Staff shortly before the Cabinet meeting on February 13th.",28-081-29,81,29,28,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-083-19,"On the basis of both previous information and reports publicly available from Ottawa Police Service that firearms had made their way into the Capital.

So I was worried about the potential chain reaction, that if the operation did not go flawlessly that it might actually escalate in more violence.

28-085-13,"So we have heard evidence about gaps that have been -- that were identified. We also heard from a number of of officials, and we saw in documentation, a lot of hesitancy around the idea of using the Emergencies Act and the possibility that it may inflame tensions, it may make things worse. There was a lot of, if I could put it this way, doubt around that. In light of that, and in light also of a lot of discussion that we have had here in the Commission about whether the threshold itself was met under the Emergencies Act, can you go there at this point and explain to us your understanding of why it -- why the threshold was met and why it was necessary in light of the hesitancy that had been expressed about the need to invoke it?",28-085-15,85,15,13,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY, Continued",MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-085-27,"Well, you've touched on a few important points in your question, so I'm going to try and unpack the questions that you've put to me. Just first on hesitancy, I would be more inclined to describe it as reluctance, and I think that that instinct was the right one. That this was a statute that was created coming out of the aftermath of the October 1970 crisis and there being real concerns about using -- resorting to the War Measures Act and using the military to restore public order, which is not the mandate or the expertise of the military, a very blunt instrument. And the creation of the Emergencies Act, which very consciously and deliberately does not make any reference to military powers, but nevertheless, affords the Government broad scope to respond to public order emergencies, and just by virtue of its title, you know, the -- if you're into an emergency, this is obviously a very serious situation, so you don't want to have to use it unless it's necessary. So that is the right posture I think of every government, that this is not a piece of legislation that we should be using in a way that is anything reserved but for the most serious situations. So that's my answer in regards to the reluctance around it. You also mentioned in your question that, you know, that this business about there being the concern that if we invoke the Emergencies Act that it might actually lead to more violence, or radicalisations I believe you heard from Mr. Vigneault and CSIS. I was very mindful of that, but I also, and colleagues at the Cabinet table, also had to weigh the risks of not invoking the Emergencies Act because there were -- the materialisation of counterprotests from individuals, specifically in Ottawa, because they were so frustrated at their inability to go to their jobs, take their kids to daycare, get access to emergency medical services, their prescriptions and the like, I mean, it was utter and total mayhem. I mean, let's call a spade a spade. And so that frustration was boiling over. And my concern in my capacity, as the Minister for Public Safety, is that if we don't equip police with the additional tools and the authorities that they need to specifically address the gaps that they had been consistently briefing us on, then that might lead to more violence. And so we also had to weigh the risks of not taking the decision to invoke. And so that -- we weighed in the potential concerns around radicalisation, but ultimately we came down on the side of invoking.",28-085-29,85,29,27,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And for me, that is the operative word, because there were authorities there were on the books, but the fact is that on the basis of what I was seeing and what I was hearing that those existing authorities were not sufficiently effective to restore public safety. And that is consistent with the advice that we were getting from various partners within the public safety community, including law enforcement, including CBSA, and other officials, as you've heard.",28-089-07,89,7,5,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-090-01,"Okay. Then the very last question -- I think I actually am now out of time, so the last question I want to ask you, Minister Mendicino, and your legal background shows in how you unpack my triple-barrelled question last time around, so this is the last barrel, the third barrel that you didn’t get to in your answer, which is the threshold for invoking a Public Order emergency, as you know, depends on identifying a threat to the security of Canada with reference to the CSIS Act. We’ve heard a lot of discussion at the Commission about how that threshold may or may not have been met, and we know that there was no specific threat to the security of Canada assessed by CSIS. Nevertheless, the government concluded that the threshold was met, presumably, because the Act was invoked. How, in your view, was that threshold met?",28-090-03,90,3,1,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY, Continued",MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-090-16,"Well, first let me address the piece about CSIS’s conclusion, and I know you’ve heard some evidence about that, but I do think it is important to emphasize that they are assessing through their mandate, which is conventionally confined to espionage and foreign interference and potential threats to cybersecurity, for the purposes of establishing a legal threshold under that statute, which then leads to potentially obtaining warrants, judicially authorized, so that we can mitigate against those potential security threats. This was very different. This was not about isolating a lone wolf or a small group; rather, it was about looking at a protest which became illegal at a national scale. And assessing -- completing that exercise also had to take a look at the broader objective and scope of the Emergencies Act, which means looking at section 2 of that statute where it talks about the presence of a serious threat, or threat of serious violence so as to exceed the capacity of any province to respond on the basis of authorities that exist. And so in my judgment, you need to kind of look at both. And that was precisely the skillset that I was applying in my role as Minister of Public Safety. Drawing on my understanding of the law and the principles as they were being applied to the facts that existed on the ground at the time. And so looking at everything in its totality, we had a situation where for two weeks we had a protest that was national in scale that overwhelmed the resources of police and other border officials, very deliberately, for a protracted period of time, where despite the existence of statutes and resources; and, in my view, as informed by counter-operational tactics that were specifically deployed to stop people from restoring public safety, the extraordinary jeopardy that it placed our economy in; the thousands of Canadians who had their jobs interrupted; the fact that businesses were shuttered; that sectors were compromised that are the literal and figurative engine of our economy; the fact that all of this was tied to a politically stated objective to overthrow the government if it refused to reverse course on pandemic policy, and the challenges that were presented to the security and intelligence community, and the broader law enforcement community, in understanding what the nature of this protest was, and why it was so difficult and challenging to restore public safety all drew me to the conclusion that we met the threshold. And, ultimately, for me at the end of the day, it worked. I’m not saying that the Emergencies Act is a perfect instrument, and my sincere hope to the Commission is that there will be some reflection about that, but it was a measure that was successfully deployed by law enforcement to restore public safety without significant injury, or any fatalities at all. And the fact that as part of the invocation of this Act, that we now have an opportunity to go over the circumstances that led to that decision in great forensic detail with witnesses testifying is, I think, an important pillar of our democratic process, which, of course, was one of the things that we were very much concerned with preserving throughout. So that is my answer with regards to the threshold and why I think it’s important that I’m here today.",28-090-18,90,18,16,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-092-28,"Thank you, sir. Sir, we’re not in a position to proceed with cross at this time. There’s two reasons. One is the federal government has disclosed over a week ago an extension volume of documents that are highly redacted. It is obvious from the face of the documents that they don’t meet the criteria for lawful redactions. A motion was made last week for those redactions to be lifted. The submissions closed on Thursday evening. We still have no ruling; a number of days have passed. For the cross-examination and the discovery of truth process to be valid and effective, the parties require access to the documents; we don’t have that. So we would appreciate some indication as to when the Commission is actually going to rule on that and hopefully compel the proper disclosure of the record so that cross- examinations can be effective. I emphasize that these documents are not related to future witnesses, but present witnesses, so we’re making the process inefficient, with all due respect, by not allowing the parties to have access to unredacted documents. The second reason we’re not in a position to proceed with our cross-examination at this time with this witness is our lead counsel, Mr. Brendan Miller, who had prepared for the cross, as you know, sir, has been removed by the room by you when he was raising a motion to find a way around the absence of a ruling on the redaction.

There have been a fair amount of back and forth, without going into detail, there’s some, let’s say, innovative type of issues that had to be dealt with. So that should come out at the lunchtime, which I’m happy to -- yeah, I will do my utmost. It’s going to come out, unfortunately probably not on the record, the website, because it won’t be translated, which is one of the issues we have to deal with, but we will -- in light of what you say, we’ll issue it in English only for the moment, and it will become -- be posted when it’s bilingual, but I understand that submission. So that should enable you. So we can put off the cross-examinations till after the lunchtime. In terms of the other problem, that’s not something I can deal with. I’ve dealt -- I’m trying to deal the best I can with the situation; and, quite frankly, if the issue had been raised the way you have now, I would have given the answer I’m giving now. So what I propose, then, since this witness will be here after lunch, we simply delay till after lunch.

28-103-10,"Totally, and you would have heard my evidence a little bit earlier this morning where I talked about navigating the principle of operational independence. I referred to Article 9.3 under Police Service Agreements which we reach with provinces, which actually do set out a mechanism and a protocol by which additional resources are requested from the Office of the Federal Minister of Public Safety, as well as the Office of the Provincial Ministers of Public Safety. One thing I didn't mention but I do think is really relevant is that in those Police Service Agreements, it is expressly contemplated under either 9.1 or 9.2 of those agreements that prior to the deployment of the intra-provincial RCMP resources, it is the elected provincial Minister of Public Safety who has to form the opinion that there is a state of emergency before they can be deployed. And it is only if existing RCMP resources within the province are overwhelmed or insufficient to deal with that emergency that you then take the next step of requesting for the deployment of RCMP resources outside of the province to deal with the situation, which is Article 9.3. And that is a request that comes to this office. My point is, I agree with you that there is a protocol there. The Emergencies Act, unfortunately, does not prescribe that process, so what we did instead was we did the best that we could having various meetings daily, ultimately, in the ERG and the Cabinet meetings where we were soliciting inputs, including, as you saw in the email that I received from Commissioner Lucki the day before, where she very specifically and thoughtfully prescribes tools that could only be granted under the Emergencies Act.

I don’t think I need to bring up your witness statement, but I’m happy to if that’s necessary. Deputy Minister Stewart testified that the purpose of the draft engagement proposal was to give protestors in Ottawa a potential exit strategy.

28-111-26,"And so in your witness statement, you indicated that there were two issues with respect to why the enforcement, or sorry, the engagement proposal didn’t come to fruition. The first was questions that were left unanswered about the convoy organizers, who they are and who was in charge. And the second related to safety concerns about the person engaged in the proposal.

So this is an email from someone at Ottawa Police, Vicky Nelson, to a number of people, including Deputy Minister Stewart. And as you can see, it says: “Good morning, On behalf of General Counsel […] please find attached the list of the convoy leaders and their affiliates.” That’s on February 7th.

And if we look at the last -- the second bullet, we see: “The risk to the signatory and government rep at a later [date --] meeting is low, assuming the meeting is virtual.” So again, would you agree that the concern that you’ve raised has been addressed as a result of a conversation between Deputy Minister Stewart and his OPP expert?",28-113-28,113,28,26,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

28-114-08,"I would say it begun to address the concerns. I don’t think I was wholly satisfied by the answers that I had gotten at that stage. In particular, I would have explored the assessment that the risk to the signatory and to the government rep was low because I needed to understand exactly where the set up was going to be, how it was going to be undertaken, and bearing in mind at the time the situation on the ground was volatile, and at times extremely chaotic, and certainly with a very compromised ability to enforce the law. I really wanted to be satisfied that those answers -- that those questions would be answered, because if I went back to Cabinet and was asked about the engagement proposal that was being worked up by my Deputy Minister, I had to be accountable and I had to be a position to answer them.

And I know that he sort of underlined that latter part on a couple of occasions, that it wasn't just the numbers it was what were the RCMP going to be dispatched to do?

So there was a free-flowing dialogue there.

And as you pointed out, and we learned later, and the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner, I think, described it as essentially about the mix up of the numbers. That the -- it wasn't actually that many Mounties, it was a way of accounting for them that added up shifts and the like.

I was hearing from a lot of staff, and from people on my team along the lines of these types of incidents, and that really preoccupied me. And as you may recall, I mean, there was one day on which we did actually have to shut down Parliament.

I believe you said that Premier Kenney expressed to you that he had neither the resources nor the tools to deal with the blockades in Alberta. And I just wanted to clarify what you meant by tools. Often in this Inquiry that term has been used to refer to legislative tools or authorities such as, you know, being able to use the Criminal Code.

What I was referring to were conversations that we had at the beginning of February where he had indicated that he needed physical tools and assets to help clear the blockade. I believe he was expressing a concern that he was having a really hard time getting access to those assets through either the RCMP or through provincial police services. So he was putting to me the suggestion that we might be able to assist him through military assets, and I’d said to him that although statutorily requests for assistance were still within my office’s authorities, but they were, in practice, being addressed by my colleague, Minister Blair, in the new Ministry that was created following the ’21 election through the Ministry of Emergency Preparedness.

In the context of conversations that I had with Premier Kenney; he’d suggested that his provincial RCMP were saying to him that they had the appropriate equipment to remove the large commercial vehicles that had blockaded Coutts since the beginning of February. So I think, in essence, what he was conveying to me is, “Look, I need help, and one of the ways in which you can help me is by looking very carefully at military assets which could help to clear the blockade in Coutts.” And he said he had a really hard time getting access to tow trucks that were large enough to accomplish that job.",28-136-11,136,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

So I think there was a concern about potentially opening up the door to other requests to insert the military, and, as you’ve heard, there was a lot of reluctance and restraint around resorting to military resources and authorities in the context of the blockade and the convoy.",28-137-03,137,3,1,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

So I do think that that does sit more neatly with the chronology and the sequencing of events as we described. I would say that my engagements with the then Minister of Justice and Solicitor General, Sonya Savage, very likely did not include any express references to the Emergencies Act.

28-141-28,"Yes. And I would just add to that that we are leveraging UNDRIP to advance important reforms within the RCMP around First Nations and Indigenous policing. And so for example, over the last number of weeks and months in my capacity as Minister of Public Safety, I have been deeply engaged with First Nations and Indigenous and Inuit communities for the purposes of ensuring that there are more Indigenous led public safety initiatives, including the creation of Indigenous led police services, which are independently created. We have also -- are in the process of codeveloping legislation that expressly recognizes that Indigenous policing is an essential service so that we can move away from the current First Nations and Indigenous policing program-based approach to one that is more structured and enduring, and uses UNDRIP and the principles of reconciliation as the anchor for a relationship between the Federal Government and Frist Nations and Indigenous policing. And then the last thing I would point out is that we are currently debating Bill C-20, which is before Parliament, which is an Act that would create a new Public Complaints and Review Commission, what we are referring to as the PCRC, and we are, again, very engaged with First Nations and Indigenous communities to ensure that there is representation on that Commission so that there can be appropriate civilian review and accountability in the way that we police and uphold the law in Indigenous communities.",28-141-30,141,30,28,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And in order to give life and breadth to that principle, it means being at the table together, starting from the premise that there needs to be a recognition of the inherent right of Indigenous peoples to chart out their own courses, to implement their own priorities as it relates to public safety, including and leading up to Indigenous police services which are self-governed. So both in that co-development exercise, as well as in Bill C-20, we are very much engaged with First Nations and Indigenous people so that they are reflected in our institutions, including when it comes to public safety.",28-143-10,143,10,8,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And part of that is addressing long, enduring, systemic structural challenges in the relationship between the federal government and Indigenous peoples that go back to, you know, the origins of colonialism. And that would apply, not only to RCMP and CBSA, but right across all of my line agencies, including CSIS.

And the hope is that by doing so, that we will create a relationship that is based on respect, on the nation- to-nation principles and values that -- that are informed by UNDRIP.

I recently had the chance to visit with the James Smith Cree Nation following the mass casualty there at the beginning of -- or at the end of summer, I beg your pardon. And so that direct, personal experience is meant to foster a relationship so that we can move forward with the kinds of reforms that are inspired and governed by UNDRIP, and by the principles of reconciliation, which have been documented in the Truth and Reconciliation calls to action; the MMIWG calls to justice. It’s a full-court press from the federal government to really move forward with those reforms, but you have to meet with people, and you have to respect that inherent right of self-government and that inherent right of self-determination. And that includes when it comes to public safety initiatives. And I think by doing so, we can break that intergenerational trauma; that endless cycle that has seen a disproportionate number of Indigenous peoples caught up in the criminal justice system, for example.

And certainly, and I hope I'm not going too far in trying to ascertain your line of questioning here, but it would be somewhat chaotic for the RCMP to simply insert themselves unilaterally into Wellington Street and start effecting arrests without coordinating very closely with the OPS and the OPP.

So: “A person can’t participate in a public assembly that may reasonably be expected to lead to a breach of the peace by the serious disruption of the movement of persons for goods for the serious interference with trade.” Let’s just stop at that one. You might be aware as an MP coming from the Province of Ontario that we’ve had some labour strikes and threats of labour strikes in the last couple of weeks.

28-170-10,"Well, I do think that we need to be very careful and circumscribed in defining what the powers are. So the prohibition of public assembly as it is itemized under the Regs. does direct that people can’t be part of a public assembly that may be reasonably expected to lead to a breach of the peace by the serious disruption of the movement of persons or goods or the serious interference with trade. Let me pause me there and say that that is directly responsive in part to CVSAs concerns around the lack of authority to clear roads adjacent to critical infrastructure in the form of the border. And you can draw a straight line to the rationale for that power. That having been said, in addition to that the Regs. still have to comply with the Emergencies Act which is the parenting statute. And what that says, is that, yes, all of the individual rights that are there around freedom of assembly, including the right to protest, are preserved so long as you do not then cross the boundary into activity which could pose a threat of serious violence. And that is the delineating limitation to how it is that we both protect Charter rights while at the same time giving circumscribed targeted powers to restore public safety.

So I mention it so that you have time to do it maybe at the break. Obviously totally up to you. I’ve had to allocate essentially everyone who asked, but the allocation is, I recognize, small. And I’m simply signalling that given tomorrow’s schedule, it’s going to be hard to be flexible. So thanks for giving me that opportunity, but I think it’s important. I’d like you to think about it. Again, it’s up to you, obviously, but my interest is that people who want to get at an important point with any one of the three witnesses have the time. Okay. with that, you have fresh time.

And I think that this particular public order emergency demonstrated what's at stake, especially around a critical port of entry like Windsor where you're talking about not only economic impacts, which, you know, have a huge, huge knock on effect, but just the critical supply chains around food, around fuel, around healthcare supplies, that is a vital artery, not only for Canada, but equally for the United States, which as I described earlier is one of the reasons why Secretary Mayorkas had engaged me in the height of the blockades.",28-188-23,188,23,21,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And one of the realities on the ground, what we were seeing, what we were receiving in the way of information from law enforcement is precisely what you described in your question, which was progress that was not linear, where at times, perhaps, you know, there may have been, you know, some travel or trade going through borders but then in other times blockages. At times, you know, there were maybe only a thousand or so individuals here in the Parliamentary Precinct or even less, but then it would surge on the weekends, and so it was that state of volatility that made it very difficult to not only restore but maintain public safety, and by then, the government, in my view, in my opinion, had already exercised considerable, I think, reflection and restraint in trying to understand why it was that existing law enforcement, resources and authorities were not effective at restoring public safety.

And if that is insufficient, I think that's where there is currently a lacuna, there is a gap. And so we worked around that gap with daily dialogue and through, you know, a lot of collaboration and coordination, so that RCMP could be deployed. I will say though, it is important to draw a distinction since you represent the membership of the RCMP in the arrangement, here in Ontario where there is a provincial Police Services Act and in other provinces where there are police service agreements, where again, and I've been I think pretty specific in my references to the articles in those agreements that have a mapped out protocol of steps where you can deploy resources of the RCMP within the province, and where that isn't sufficient, to then pull RCMP officers from other provinces under Article 9.3. And I believe that that could be potentially a roadmap for an ongoing discussion about how municipal, provincial and federal law enforcement authorities can work together to address potential future public order emergencies.",28-211-08,211,8,6,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

28-233-10,"I appreciate the spoiler alert, given the witness who testified who has an abundance of police experience under his belt. But I would say this is precisely the type of question that really ought to be explored through the ongoing deliberations of this Commission, and I suppose, Your Honour, I would impart a few principles to you, as you are trying to think through exactly where to delineate the boundaries. One is, as I said, we don’t want elected politicians to go behind the veil and politicize the constituent elements of the traditional administration of justice, so exactly what kinds of investigations are being conducted, who lays charges, whether or not those charges proceed to trial, whether or not there are any sanctions or remedies that flow from that. That is all properly within either the independent discretion of police or the Crown. And I believe that those should be protected as sacrosanct as part of our democracy. On the other hand, police and the elected government do not operate as two solitudes, that there does have to be an ongoing channel of communication around how it is that we support one another in maintaining public safety. And there are some customs that have developed over time in how we strike that balance. One is, as I hope I've been able to demonstrate today, through the authorities that are exercised by the office that I occupy in ensuring accountability, in pressing for questions and obtaining information so that we can be sure that law enforcement have all of the tools that they need and the resources that they need to maintain public safety, and where they don’t, to give those things that they don’t have to them so that they can restore it and then maintain it. That is something that I did in the course of the blockades and the occupation in the case of Alberta, where ---",28-233-11,233,11,10,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

28-234-16,"Yeah. So then I think that the question then becomes, you know, how far can elected governments go in identifying priorities? And I think it will depend very much on the circumstances, but one, again, I think established threshold that already exists by convention under the police service agreements that we have is that Provincial Ministers of Justice are able to form the opinion of where an emergency exists. And why is that important? Because once that is -- once that opinion has been formed, then resources can be deployed. I think that that is a principle that might be potentially expanded or that could be explored on a national scale, because then there might be a way to stitch together the way law enforcements operate and cooperate at the municipal, provincial, and federal levels. I do think though, as you consider that question, that you also have to, I think, take an inventory and a landscape of the big gap that exists right now between provincial police services acts and the Emergencies Act. And the Emergencies Act does afford the elected government a fair bit of scope and latitude. But what we did here was rather than just divine those tools, we looked to law enforcement to identify where those gaps existed and then used that to fill them in with the regulations under the Emergencies Act to address the situation at hand. It will be very much driven by the particular circumstances of each case. So coming back to your hypothetical, I think it is possible, and it doesn’t have to be even Ontario, but let’s assume your hypothetical was in Alberta. It is open to the Minister of the Solicitor General there, or the Minister of Public Safety in Alberta, to determine which of those two may constitute an emergency or not. And by exercising that discretion, then open the door to granting the requests of assistance to deploy additional resources and to make that decision on the basis of the police, who can then operationalize where to go first based on where the emergency is at.

28-236-07,"Well again, I mean, I -- and I want to be as responsive as I possibly can be, and we are working with a hypothetical, but I guess the most -- the dilemma would be if both events were absolutely identical, would it be appropriate for the elected government to sort of pick? And I tend to -- I’m inclined to agree with Minister Blair, that that’s not the kind of choice or dilemma you want. On the other hand, if they’re not completely identical and there is a threshold question as to whether or not one poses an emergency as opposed to the other, then I think on the basis of some conventions that already exist under the Police Services Agreement, it may be appropriate for elected government to say, “No, there is an emergency here,” and that then opens the door to deploying police services. But I think going beyond that, for example, the number of police officers, precisely the type of equipment that is used, all of the other things that I’ve already outlined to you, elected governments should steer wide clear of that, and for good reason.

Mr. Mendicino, who you saw earlier today, about the Transport Minister, for example, in some cases the Justice Minister.

There should not be an unconstitutional leap to pin this on the feds or the RCMP. Federally under mutual assistance agreements we can/should provide resources and personnel, as requested, but the authority and responsibility rests with the municipality and the province.

Scrolling down, please, Mr. Clerk? “It remains essential to delve deeply into the true genesis of this demonstration and who is controlling and directing it.

Our intelligence and national security experts must absolutely get to the bottom of this horrific set of events.

So we had seen obviously a pretty significant failure of municipal authorities in Ottawa in those weeks that preceded this, and I thought his insights into the responsibility of different orders of Government and not –- perhaps because it was the nation’s capital, there was a great deal of confusion certainly in the public conversation about what’s the Government of Canada doing about Wellington street?

It’s a federal vaccine mandate and it’s happening at parliament so this is a really a federal problem.” Is that a fair characterization, do you think, of what Ontario’s initial attitude was?",28-248-12,248,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-248-26,"I’m not sure. I can’t speak for the Government of Ontario or what Premier Ford or his ministers were thinking. But as I said, in the initial arrival of the convoy in Ottawa, the focus was on the Nation’s Capital. As we know, it quickly spread to other cities and other parts of the country, not just in the Province of Ontario. But we did, as a national government -- and my colleagues, I know, the Transport Minister, Mr. Mendicino himself and senior officials of our government, deputy ministers, were engaging in active and ongoing discussions with their Ontario counterparts as the situation in Ottawa was becoming more entrenched to see if every possible provincial regulatory or legislative authority was being brought to bear to try and resolve, ultimately, not only Ottawa, of course, but Windsor and other places. So I think our government -- and I remember those conversations from the incident response group meetings or the Cabinet Security and Safety Committee. There was an ongoing and active effort, both at the level of ministers, but senior officials supporting them, to reach out to provincial jurisdictions where they were seeing some of the sort of sympathy or knock-on effects of the Ottawa occupation to make sure that every available authority was being brought to bear to bring these illegal events to a conclusion.",28-248-28,248,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-249-24,"Yeah, I think that -- and obviously the inability across the country to use existing provincial and municipal authorities was one of the constant discussions before our government as we led up to the ultimate decision to invoke the Emergencies Act. But I remember, from the very beginning, an effort to educate ourselves as a government -- and Mr. Goodale’s email, to some extent, speaks to that -- in terms of the different jurisdictional roles of orders of government, but we quickly understood the importance of collaborating and ensuring that municipal and provincial authorities were very much working with federal agencies that could provide support -- and there are a number of federal agencies that were working with their counterparts, of course -- but to really use every available remedy to bring these very damaging illegal occupations or blockades to an end.",28-249-26,249,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-250-23,"So it was on the evening of February 10th. I remember, as you said, it was following that Incident Response Group meeting. I left Ottawa to fly home to Moncton, New Brunswick, and I had been asked to talk to Premier Ford specifically around what we thought were some authorities the province had in the transportation sector around trucking licences, permits, insurance certificates. I’m certainly not an expert on the precise regulatory authorities around provincial transportation sectors, but there was a belief that the Province of Ontario may have a series of instruments or authorities that perhaps hadn’t been brought to bear, whether it was in Windsor or in Ottawa, so it was suggested that I could perhaps reach out to Premier Ford. I have a very constructive and cordial relationship with the Premier of Ontario. I texted him to say I was leaving for News Brunswick and would like to chat to him that evening, if possible, and would be at home in two hours in Moncton, and he told me to call him when I landed. And I remember being at home; it was about 10:30 or 11:00 in the evening in New Brunswick. He was still at his office at Queen’s Park in Toronto. I said I was calling him to talk about what we thought were some additional authorities that the Government of Ontario may have that could be brought to bear over the circumstance in the Windsor and, obviously, in Ottawa, and he immediately went to the process that his government was going through, which ultimately led to their declaration of an emergency order the following day. So the conversation quickly evolved into what Premier Ford was planning to do the following day and, frankly, it went well beyond what we were hoping in terms of some trucking or transportation regulatory authorities. He was very much focused on the economic damage to the Province of Ontario and to the country. He talked to me about conversations he’d had with the Governor of Michigan, the chief executives of some of the big auto companies, representatives of some of the big unions. He was extremely focused on the severe economic damage to Ontario and to the country. He was focused on the reputational damage that this means in terms of foreign investment into our country. And he was very focused on the public safety concerns and the threats of real violence that people were still continuing to advance in Ottawa and in Windsor. So the conversation -- he was quite candid with me about his desire to have the Ontario Provincial Police take a greater role in the Windsor context, and also in Ottawa. He talked about his frustration that the situation in Ottawa had not been resolved and his government was very involved and committed to stepping out, including with the Government of Canada, to do what we needed to bring this to a conclusion across the Province of Ontario. And I offered, obviously, as had my cabinet colleagues, to provide any federal resources, policing resources, regulatory authorities that the Government of Canada may have to support the plan that he outlined to me in that conversation. And then the next day, he had a news conference which laid out most of what he’d told me in that -- on that evening conversation.",28-250-25,250,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

I know my colleague, the Transport Minister, who I think you’ll see tomorrow, had spoken to his counterpart, the Secretary of Transportation in the United States. So in those meetings, those Americans, we were told by our colleagues or senior officials who had conversations with senior American authorities including, as I say, our Transport Minister who spoke to his American counterpart, that they were prepared to do whatever they could to support our efforts to bring this illegal activity, these border blockades, to an end. And my understanding -- and if I said that to the Premier, it’s because somebody would have told us that the American authorities were prepared to help us. If there were convictions of some of these truck drivers, for example, they would look at what authorities they had in the United States to bar them from entering the United States.",28-253-07,253,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So Minister, this is, as it's being pulled up, I think shortly after that call you reported on it to the PMO, and so this is your text where you're conveying Premier Ford's position and: ""Spoke to Ford. He is going gangbusters on truckers tomorrow. Using Emergency Order—fines, seizing trucks, arrests, suspension of licenses.. he is...hot to hammer them at a presser tomorrow at 10am. [He'll]..."" Sorry: ""He will introduce legislation to make sure this can't happen again—and wants us to work on plan together to secure border/critical infrastructure going forward. He will then do a presser on Monday to diminish public health measures—but tomorrow is hard on enforcing against blockades."" Response comes, ""Excellent"".

And that, I think, probably was a message that I would have sent to the Prime Minister's Office following that conversation that evening on the 10th of February, and it's certainly faithful to my recollection of that conversation. What I would do is, as I would talk to or exchange messages with the premiers, I would often ensure that Michael Vandergrift, the senior official at Privy Council Office, had a readout of the substance of those calls that he could then circulate as well, but that would have been a message I would have sent to the Prime Minister's Office. And I certainly agree with your characterisation. That evening, I finished the conversation with Premier Ford very reassured that the governments were going to work together to bring this to a conclusion, not just in Windsor, but obviously in Ottawa, and I would think the 10 or 12 days that followed were a proof point that that was the case.",28-255-06,255,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

I knew, and I think we saw Mr. Mendicino talk about that today, that the Government of Alberta had considerable concerns around the ability to get tow trucks with respect to the blockage at the border crossing in Coutts, Alberta, and I knew, again from probably Bill Blair or Marco at Incident Response Group meetings, that the Government of Alberta was seeking potentially some military assets to help -- heavy military tow trucks to move some of these trucks from the border blockage in Coutts.

28-259-25,"Sure. So you'll see, I think it was the Saturday, February 12th, that was the weekend we were having I think daily, almost daily Incident Response Group meetings that the Prime Minister was chairing in which I was participating. The situation from our perspective was becoming more and more alarming. There were a lot of public discussions of potential pop up blockades or demonstrations, and I'm going by memory, but a number of provincial legislatures saw demonstrations. There were some in Toronto, some in Quebec City, a number of provincial capitals. There was public discussion of a number of potential border crossings being targeted as well. There was some discussion about a border crossing in Woodstock, New Brunswick with the State of Maine in my home province. There were concerns around the Pacific Gateway border crossing in British Columbia. I know one of the discussions, again that was reported in the media or certainly in social media, was a potential sort of sympathy protest at the ferry terminal in North Sydney, which is the main supply route for the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador for the Island of Newfoundland. So on that Saturday, I wanted to reach out principally to a group of premiers in Atlantic Canada and Premier Horgan in British Columbia, who were seeing some of this activity and sympathy to the occupation that was taking place in Ottawa. I wanted to offer those premiers again, as they knew from their conversations between their senior officials but I wanted them to hear from me that the Government of Canada was absolutely ready inasmuch as we could to provide any support that they thought would be useful. The RCMP in many of those provinces are also the contract police authority and some of the premiers had said to me that they were receiving updates from the Divisional commanders of the RCMP in their capacity as the contract police of jurisdiction in those provinces. I remember Premier Furey telling me of his real concern around a potential blockage at the ferry terminal in North Sydney. He’s a doctor by profession and told me that on that ferry many medical supplies, drugs, medical equipment, is essentially transmitted to Port aux Basques in Newfoundland and then distributed around the province. And if ever there was a blockage of access to that ferry terminal, it’s much more than fresh fruits and vegetables in grocery stores in Newfoundland. But it represented a real threat to public safety and security in his province. So I wanted them to know that we were monitoring those situations. We were receiving updates from senior federal officials in the law enforcement community and in the intelligence community, and that if they had any concerns they could reach out to me. That was the nature of those conversations and on the Sunday, on February 13th, Premier Horgan, I'm assuming -- I would have sent those messages and followed up on the Saturday the 12th, but if it shows up on the 13th, it’s because Premier Horgan probably replied to me on the Sunday the 13th to talk to me about some of the concerns we were seeing in the media around the Pacific Gateway border crossing.",28-259-27,259,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-262-06,"Okay. And we know that Premier Ford did, in fact, invoke Ontario’s Emergency legislation on February 11th. So you mentioned that Premier Furey was expressing a concern about -- if I can put it this way -- there was no identified sort of threat to the supply chain but he was concerned that what was happening might spread and affect the supply chain in Newfoundland.

So I was seeing in public discussions the risk or the threat or the discussion of potential attempts to block access to the North Sydney ferry terminal, the Marine Atlantic Ferry. And it reminded me of the vulnerability of half a million Canadians on the island of Newfoundland and Labrador in terms of what is their main supply route for things as important as medicines, medical equipment, and so on. And that was the concern the Premier had expressed to me.

There were protests, I think, in the city -- I’m going by memory -- in Halifax. And of course, Premier King, that Confederation Bridge to Prince Edward Island is obviously a critical supply route for that province as well. That’s not far from where I live, that bridge. It’s a two-lane bridge and it wouldn’t theoretically take much to create a lot of confusion in accessing that bridge.

He was very clear that he had not come to a conclusion around invoking the Emergencies Act, that he was going to hear from premiers the following day. But the discussion was amongst ministers in terms of what are the steps that we -- what are the steps that are necessary to bring these illegal occupations and blockades to an end, and to restore some sense of public confidence because even if particular activities or blockades were perhaps being resolved -- Ottawa certainly wasn’t -- but there was a concern, as I said about a spreading effect or what would be the knock-on effect. So he listened to ministers. We were briefed by the senior officials responsible for a number of federal law enforcement agencies, the National Security Advisor, for example, the Commissioner of the RCMP, the Canadian Border Services, some of the officials I’m sure you've interviewed would have described to ministers their sense of the evolving situation.

So we thought that it would have been irresponsible to risk that going out into the public space before the First Ministers had had an opportunity, absent from everybody’s early morning radio shows to talk to the prime minister about that issue. So there were two reasons probably why Mr. Vandergrift didn’t put a subject line. One was to minimize the inevitable leak to a media or in the public space. We had a lot of experience with First Ministers' meetings in the COVID context and very rarely were those discussions not, in some extent, reflected in public comments, so that was a concern. But also, I think there was a desire from the Privy Council Office to as much as was possible, to as much as was possible, to allow first ministers to have that conversation with the prime minister at 10:15 on the 14th, absent, as I said, the public discourse that would have inevitably followed about should we, will we, did the government decide that as much as possible, would have been counterproductive to an open and frank discussion amongst first ministers.",28-266-17,266,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

But we've seen subsequently, we've seen subsequently premiers who had expressed in that meeting concerns around the public effect of a discussion of a potential invocation, so the shortest period of time between the public discussion around should the government or will the government proceed to an invocation of the Emergencies Act, the shorter period of time would perhaps be conducive with the public safety imperative of making that decision in a way that was responsible.",28-267-26,267,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

But can you tell us a little bit about how those meetings were convened and how they proceeded and what they were about, because obviously, we know that they -- those meetings touched, in part on whether emergency legislation would be appropriate in that context.",28-268-23,268,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-269-05,"So obviously, in the context of the pandemic, federal-provincial cooperation on public health measures, on things as important as vaccine procurements, vaccine distributions, border measures, the Government of Canada has responsibility obviously for international borders. So there was a very effective, I would argue, and extensive federal-provincial collaboration around the fight against COVID. That was one of, I think, our country's successes in terms of managing our federation. That required, in some cases, weekly or bi-weekly calls the prime minister would convene with first ministers. I would participate in most if not all of those calls, usually as an observer. But the prime minister wanted to coordinate as much as possible the various public health measures. Dr. Tam would provide updates. So that was an ongoing discussion. At one point, there was a discussion -- I don't remember, but I think it was in 2020 in the first months potentially of the pandemic around could the Emergencies Act be an instrument that would be helpful in our collective fight against COVID? And I think my colleague, David Lametti, consulted some of his provincial and territorial counterparts -- or not some of -- consulted provincial and territorial counterparts. There was a process and the government concluded that at that moment -- there was never a conclusion that we would never or could never perhaps have recourse to the Emergencies Act around the COVID measures, but certainly we concluded, having had that conversation with premiers and public health experts, that it wouldn't have been a particularly advisable tool at that particular moment.",28-269-07,269,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

I made a brief intervention at the front end of that conversation. The prime minister began by stressing that he had not come to a decision on whether we should invoke the federal Emergencies Act. He spoke at length in terms of these measures would not supplant existing provincial authorities. I think later in the conversation there was some discussion about whether command structures of provincial police authorities would change. The Prime Minister wanted to, at the front end of the meeting, make it very clear that these were designed to be complimentary measures that provincial and municipal law enforcement authorities could use when they thought they were needed. He was very clear that it should be a proportionate series of measures, proportionate to the real public order emergency that the government was seeing to the threat to the safety and security of Canadians. And he also made it clear to the Premiers at the front end that nothing in the invocation of the Emergencies Act would take away the Charter protections that Canadians enjoyed, and that this could be done in a way that was compliant with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.",28-272-23,272,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So Premier Horgan sees -- he says: “Approach sounds measured and practical. We are susceptible as anyone across the country.” But then he says: “Only concern is that these measures would be implemented by [the] RCMP […] which are already fully taxed.” And then: “Concern about emboldening those losing public support. People are exhausted […], but have taken three shorts […]. Worry that too heavy a hand may embolden others.” But then he says in the end: “Would support this at this stage.” So can you explain to us, in your words, essentially, what Premier Horgan was conveying to you at the meeting?",28-273-19,273,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

This time he started in British Columbia. And Premier Horgan reflected or offered a concern that was shared by a number of Premiers during that conversation, around the potential risk of inflaming or emboldening some of the actors that were already entrenched at various blockades or in the City of Ottawa. He talked about the importance of the proportionality of it, that the measures have to be targeted to the specific threat, but the measures would need to be tailored to bring it to a successful and safe conclusion as quickly as possible. A number of premiers, I think Premier Horgan, it’s not reflected in these notes, but a number of premiers expressed their concern for what they saw was happening in the City of Ottawa. That clearly was a source of a lot of national attention. But Premier Horgan -- we took Premier Horgan’s support to be very important because his province had not been immune from some activity, including some threats to the Pacific Border crossing with Washington State.",28-274-14,274,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-275-17,"No, it wasn’t discussed, by my recollection, until she raised it. One of the confusions that I worried about, and is reflected in the interview summaries of our conversation in Vancouver, because this was the first time the Emergencies Act was potentially going to be invoked, many people went back to the 1970’s context, where the legislation had a different name, and some of the enforcement was not done by civilian police officers, or some of the physical security presence, I think is a better way to say it, was not only done by civilian police officers. So Premier Cochrane raised it and the Prime Minister, I think later on in the meeting, made it very clear that having military personnel deployed in an enforcement or security context on the streets in Canada was an absolute last resort and it was not being contemplated whatsoever in any of the conversations we had in terms of what might be the measures in a potential declaration. So he very quickly, I think, tried to clear up Premier Cochrane’s misunderstanding about the role of the military. It was not being considered and it wasn’t a context that the government was looking at.",28-275-19,275,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-276-11,"Okay. And since you raised it actually, let me ask you this. The misperception of the -- between the Emergencies Act and its predecessor, the War Measures Act, is that something you were picking up a lot over these three weeks? Over the events of the convoy?",28-276-13,276,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-276-16,"I think so, because this was a unique moment heretofore in Canada where the successor legislation was potentially going to be invoked for a public order emergency. The criteria were different, the protection of the Charter, of course, wasn’t present in 1970. So the juridical and constitutional context was different. That’s why a previous Parliament passed the Emergencies Act some, I guess, four decades ago. But yeah, we worried about that public misunderstanding. Il n’y a pas de doute qu’au Québec, les commentaires du Premier Ministre Legault, lors de son intervention plus tard dans les notes que vous avez, était, je crois... et ça c’est mon impression, et je l’ai partagée avec la Ministre Lebel du Québec suite à la discussion des premiers ministres, que c’était pas du tout le même contexte. Il y avait aucune autorité fédérale qui allait remplacer une autorité municipale ou provinciale, surtout en ce qui a trait aux corps policiers. Il demeurait encore une confusion, moi je dirais, profonde quant à l’application de la loi et moi je pensais que c’était important de rassurer le Premier ministre du Québec, mais les autres premiers ministres, comme la Première ministre des Territoires du Nord-Ouest que c’était pas du tout le cas.",28-276-18,276,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-278-08,"...lors de cette discussion. Je pense que le Premier ministre lui a rassuré et j’ai fait la même chose avec son ministre des Relations canadiennes, Madame Lebel, suite à la rencontre des premiers ministres, qu’une proclamation potentielle allait pas remplacer les autorités existantes au Québec ou ailleurs au Canada, que la GRC allait pas prendre une autorité policière au Québec qui n’existait pas avant la proclamation. J’ai aussi discuté, dans mon cas, avec Madame Lebel suite à la rencontre, la situation à Gatineau et ultimement, il y a eu l’aide, je crois des corps policiers de Gatineau et la Sûreté du Québec dans les ententes qui existaient entre les provinces pour partager des ressources policières dans le besoin. Le Premier ministre a soulevé l’importance du poste frontalier à Lacolle et l’importance pour le commerce international. Il y avait possiblement des discussions d’un blocus dans ce sens-là. Mais nous étions d’accord, d’ailleurs, avec le Premier ministre Legault que la situation au Québec, que ce soit dans la Ville de Québec ou à Montréal, a été très bien maitrisée par les autorités locales et provinciales. Ils n’ont pas eu la situation difficile qui s’est implantée à Ottawa. Alors c’était pour rassurer le Premier ministre du Québec que c’était pas une question de prendre juridiction dans sa province. Au contraire, c’était d’offrir des outils potentiels dans le cas où les outils seront nécessaires aux autorités provinciales au Québec. On a aussi expliqué que les mesures économiques, qui étaient une des raisons, je crois, importantes dans la décision d’utiliser la Loi sur les mesures d’urgence parce que sans la Loi sur les mesures d’urgence, ces mesures économiques et financières n’auraient pas été possibles, que le Québec pourra se trouver dans une situation où les autorités policières auraient identifié un compte bancaire ou une autre transaction financière dans la Province du Québec, qu’il fallait peut-être geler ou qu’il fallait enquêter. Alors c’était surtout les aspects économiques qui auraient pu avoir une présence dans la Province du Québec mais c’était, à ce moment-là, hypothétique, mais je l’ai partagé avec Madame LeBel pour essayer d’aider la compréhension de tout le monde de qu’est-ce qui était une situation tout à fait nouvelle devant tous les ordres de gouvernement.",28-278-10,278,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-279-22,"En fait, c’était ma prochaine question parce que l’avis exprimé ici par le Premier ministre Legault était aussi exprimé par d’autres, en fait. Si je peux dire, why does it have to apply here? Why in our province? You may be having a problem in Ottawa, you may be having a problem at the Ambassador Bridge but we’re not having a problem in say Saskatchewan or Manitoba; that was a view expressed by several provinces. And so was any serious thought given to an approach to the Emergencies Act that would be targeted in the sense of where the measures would apply?",28-279-24,279,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,Me SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
28-280-04,"Sure. The government considered one option under the Act and I don’t have a complete juridico sense of the different interoperability of different sections of the Emergencies Act, but there is a possibility to invoke it in a geographically specific context. That was determined not to be the appropriate course of action. I think for two reasons. First of all, the concern about the financial measures, which we believed and which law enforcement senior officials of the finance department believed might be one of the most effective ways to bring this illegal occupation or these blockades to an end, is to choke off the very real supply of money that they were generating in ways that hadn’t been contemplated perhaps when some of this legislation was drafted. So that instrument was seen as one of the effective, and in my view it turned out to be quite effective, in dissuading other protest activities and bringing to a conclusion, particularly the context in Ottawa. So there was the requirement for a national application of the Act to ensure that those economic and financial measures if you’re a trucker from New Brunswick that’s parked on Wellington Street and your bank account is at the Caisse Populaire UNI in Caraquet, New Brunswick, you shouldn’t be able to evade the financial measures that were necessary, in our view, to bring this to a conclusion. And the other very compelling reason from our perspective to have a national application, was because the situation was very dynamic and it was very fluid, and it wasn’t clear that if the Ambassador Bridge had been, and was in the process of being cleared, it wasn’t clear that these people wouldn’t come back; it wasn’t clear that they wouldn’t show up in another jurisdiction. There were still threats identified in other provinces so we thought that the national application in the event that there was a sympathy or pop-up blockade that was illegal, it would give the law enforcement authorities in those jurisdictions those instruments, but it also had a dissuasive effect. It would have allowed enforcement authorities to designate critical infrastructure to prevent people from bringing children into an illegal protest or illegal occupation, so we think that it had a dissuasive effect in terms of spreading the serious and illegal occupation in Ottawa to other jurisdictions across the country.",28-280-06,280,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-281-19,"So it’s really those two branches or those two aims?

28-281-25,"That’s right. Maybe the second one might be sort of 2(a) and 2(b). There was a dissuasive element but there was also the preventative element of giving those jurisdictions those tools should they suddenly arise that the Ferry Terminal to Newfoundland was blocked, that we wouldn’t have to reinvoke some special measure to allow the authorities in the Province of Nova Scotia to have the measures to designate a critical piece of infrastructure and to render illegal an activity that was designed to disrupt the peace in one of those contexts.",28-281-27,281,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So, Minister LeBlanc, as you know the consultation with the provinces is part and parcel of the Emergencies Act under section 25; it’s an obligation that must be fulfilled before the Act can be involved, So this is –- what we’re looking at right now, is the decision note prepared by the Clerk of the Privy Council delivered to the Prime Minister on February 14th.

She summarizes the various opinions that were expressed and then she says: “This First Ministers Meeting will mee the requirements for consultations with the provinces under the Emergencies Act. And then follows that with a letter.

But a number of discussions between my Cabinet colleagues and their counterparts in the provinces and territories between senior officials of our Government, in multi-lateral fora, and some cases bilaterally with provincial and territorial officials, informed our Government’s conclusion that existing provincial municipal authorities were going to be inadequate to bring this to a safe and expeditious conclusion. So this one meeting was the moment where the Prime Minister shared his views on the potential invocation of the Emergencies Act, but as I said, there were ongoing and active bilateral and multi-lateral conversations at almost every level of our Government that were necessary inputs into the Government’s decision to proceed to the Emergencies Act as the source of final authority or the last resort in terms concluding this serious threat to Canadian safety and security.",28-283-10,283,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

It describes the various engagements that were had about the political and officials’ level over the course of the convoy events. Sorry, Mr. Clerk, can you just keep scrolling for a little bit. Scroll down and we see the Prime Minister speaking to the Premiers. Scroll down again, scroll down again, keep scrolling. Keep scrolling, And then we see on page –- I’ve lost count, “Consultations on the Emergencies Act with the First Ministers.” And this describes the actual consultation with the First Ministers that we’ve just gone through. So if I take what you’re saying, and if I’m not putting it fairly, then please correct me, but the consultation requirement was fulfilled in the Clerk’s advice, and in your view, by the First Ministers meeting at which the Premiers were directly consulted about their views on the Emergencies Act but that was also, in some sense, informed by discussions that had been had broadly around the topic of how to resolve this problem prior to that.",28-283-29,283,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

28-285-01,"Exactly. There was a very deep and a pervasive effort on our Government’s part to engage with provincial officials and Ministers, in some cases municipal authorities, particularly to canvas that very issue of our we missing some provincial regulatory authority, some municipal authority that may assist in concluding some of the illegal blockades or occupations, but also get ahead of some of the discussion of other potential flareups. So we viewed the consultation as much more than one particular meeting. If you will, that was the conclusion of the consultative effort. But as I said, many ministers and senior officials of our government had been engaged for many weeks with provincial and territorial officials on what collectively we needed to do to manage a situation that was becoming increasingly alarming, was spreading geographically. The risk of violence or public disorder was growing, not diminishing in some cases. So the trend lines were all worrisome and that was part of the ongoing discussions. The First Ministers meeting was the formal moment where the prime minister heard from all the premiers. And I think it might be instructive -- as I said, he started on the west coast and went to the east coast with a trip across the north to hear from the territorial premiers. He did not cut anyone off. There were -- unlike your questioning and the Commissioner’s rules on time limits, there were no time limits on that conversation. He would have stayed on that call for as long as any premier wanted to talk. He cut nobody off. He answered some questions as premiers would ask them. Sometimes ministers -- David Lametti, in particular -- so every premier on that call had an unlimited opportunity to share his or her views with the prime minister and some ministers and at the end he asked if anybody had anything else to add before he concluded by saying he had not made a decision and that he would reflect on what he had heard, and the Governor-in-Council process was engaged later that day.",28-285-03,285,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So the COVID context was much more than Intergovernmental Affairs.

And I know may of the premiers, because they told me, were also being briefed on an active and ongoing basis, in some cases by RCMP commanders in their particular provinces, because the divisional commanders of the RCMP are of course contract police in that jurisdiction, and they were having ongoing and active discussions with Public Safety ministers in those provinces.

We all know the list of very difficult circumstances that the pandemic brought. So we acknowledge that. And certainly, as the convoy was taking form, and the first day that we saw on Parliament Hill, there were probably a number of lawful protestors that came to express that sentiment.

One of the challenges was, the bridge itself may have a different jurisdictional scope but access to an international border crossing in this case is properly in the municipal streets of the City you represent, so that is exactly why it was important for us to have the appropriate situational awareness as we contemplated what would be the appropriate tools that might assist municipal and provincial authorities in bringing this to a conclusion.",28-323-20,323,20,18,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

Good. And if we can just scroll down. So it’s really the last sentence of the first paragraph, but we’ll start once sentence prior: “Granted the volume of the protest in Ottawa was greater and came without as much warning, but the City of Ottawa and the OPS have proven themselves incapable of grappling with this problem.” And I get that’s not your statement, it’s his, so I’m going to park it. But it’s the last sentence: “And it is now the duty of the responsible senior authority - i.e., the Public Safety Minister of ONTARIO under PROVINCIAL policing legislation - to rectify that problem, including talking control, if and as necessary.” So the follow-up question I had was, and my understanding is the public safety of the Minister of Ontario is in fact the Solicitor-General of Ontario; is that your understanding as well?",28-325-03,325,3,1,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

He spoke to me about the role that he thought the OPP was increasingly going to be playing in support of the necessary public safety measures to clear the City of Ottawa and obviously on that evening the circumstance in Windsor had not been resolved. So Premier Ford spoke to me about his strong belief that the Ontario Provincial Police could and would be a very important source of support, but in terms of what’s the right command structure, I can’t speak to that, but I do know that there was very real desire from the Premier, and that view was shared by some of my Cabinet colleagues in the updates they would give to the incident response group meetings because, as I say, these discussions, if it was Commissioner Lucki, if it was the National Security Advisor, Intelligence Advisor, the Prime Minister, there were many and multiple discussions, particularly with the Province of Ontario, but not exclusively, around all of these measures, including the appropriate sharing of police resources to try and bring these to a conclusion.",28-327-05,327,5,3,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

Certainly the Quebec City Police with the Sûreté du Québec were seen to have handled it very effectively. And I also remember the City of Toronto, the very real concerns around some potential blockages at the legislature at Queen's Park in Toronto, but as we know that University Avenue is a critical access to many of the country's best hospitals. So those kind of conversations or potential protest attracted certainly our attention as a national government, and again, without having been briefed on the operational command of which police force did what, to the observer, and Mr. Goodale was observing this from London in the United Kingdom, I would agree with his assessment that in Toronto it looked like the Toronto Police had effectively handled that situation.

And one of the reasons why ultimately the governor in council, the cabinet concluded that the Emergencies Act was a necessary and proportionate use of last resort was because it enabled in the Emergencies Act authorities to give local enforcement authorities the ability to compel tow truck operators or tow trucks -- and I may not be using the precise words -- but this was seen as part of the solution to bring these blockades to a conclusion. It was not tenable to say, ""We can't enforce municipal bylaws, Criminal Code bylaws because we can't find somebody to tow a truck away from a critical piece of infrastructure as important as the Ambassador Bridge.""

So in order to keep that particular border crossing open, there was a level of very significant and sustained police presence required. The injunctive relief, as you noted, continued. There was an issue of potentially spreading too thin police resources. So, in our view, the Emergencies Act had a dissuasive and deterrent affect that may make it possible for other particular pieces of critical infrastructure or other municipal streets not to be affected in this way once people understood the financial measures and the local law enforcement authorities had these additional tools to designate areas -- and your colleague’s spoken about this earlier -- as a way to manage potential pop-up or sympathy protests.

03-018-16,"Well the numbers -- this speaks to the information that we had heading into the end of the first weekend. And the information the City was receiving, even though we did receive information from other parties, just as the hoteliers, was pieces of information that was fed into police. Police were responsible, and are responsible, and have the access to the intelligence and the information across the country at the federal and provincial level to make the risk assessment that we all need to participate in to be able to respond appropriately. So all of this information, it was moving around. I think early emails had two to 300, or 50 trucks, and then it kind of escalated as the week went on, I think from about January 24th, on. And the numbers were growing and they were varying and there was different pieces of information coming in. We rely on the police to gather that information, collate that with all of the information they have, and make a risk assessment to provide to the City in terms of the strategies they’re going to take to mitigate that risk. And so from my point of view, and I’ve been doing this a long time, in terms of dealing with emergencies, it wasn’t unusual to have a variance in the views of people who thought it was going to be bigger, longer, you know, smaller. There were all kinds of opinions on what that would be.

And the assumption was that they were going to leave. They had previous experience with the farmer's convoy where tractors and other heavy trucks came into the core. They did leave after the event. It wasn't a significant event from a policing perspective. And the comment back here is that police made a decision in terms of how were they going to manage the influx of trucks coming in. And if the streets weren't going to be closed, and basically, a zone created -- a no-go zone for vehicles wasn't going to be created, the risk was they were going to leave their vehicles on the 417 and neighbourhoods all over the city and just walk away and leave the parks and disrupt the entire city. And so the strategy, from what I understand, it was to try and get them into a footprint to be able to contain them and be able to manage the protesters in a smaller area, so that's what I'm reflecting in that text message back.",03-024-07,24,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

We had to reroute ambulances, fire trucks. We had to change all our protocols in terms of being able to sustain our services, the continuity of our services. Garbage pickup, snow removal, all those things had to be looked at from the perspective of how do we work around that area. And we had to create an emergency lane within that zone, protect that emergency lane for emergency vehicles.

There was also the operational aspect based on the assumption that they were going to leave, that keeping the footprint contained would be more beneficial to the police to be able to manage the crowds and not spread their resources too thin because it always is a challenge for resources.

03-029-01,"No, because police took a different strategy in terms of how were they going to manage the protest. So we wouldn't close roads without the support of the police partners, Ottawa Police in particular. Because if you're closing roads and you're putting hard barricades, we had -- and I had some counselors, you know, tell me that -- or ask me to put barricades in front of streets, trying to block streets from other trucks going in the neighborhoods. And the challenge most people don't understand is that life still goes on despite the fact you’re in this crisis, and that fire trucks, paramedics, snowplows, garbage pick up, maybe water service crews if a pipe bursts in the winter which we we’re having a lot of those, have to get into those streets. So if you’re blocking with a hard barricade any street in Ottawa, unless you're closing the street completely, and you're not allowing anyone in there -- but if residents are there, they are obviously allowed to go back in -- you need to staff that barricade with a physical person -- with a person who can allow people to enter and access that depending on the requirement legally. And so, the notion that you know, we would close streets on our own has been thrown out, why did the city of Ottawa close streets? Well, we would never close streets without the agreement, collaboration, and participation of Ottawa Police to ensure that it aligned with their operational plans, to ensure that they could stop them, and they had enough resources to put people at the actual access, and that it didn't impede with something else that they were planning with respect to managing the protest.",03-029-03,29,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So they were concerned about that. They were concerned about the damage, potentially, to their own vehicle, should things get out of hand. And it’s a cost to their business. Some were concerned that they do business with truckers and trucking companies, and that would damage them reputationally and they would lose business.

03-042-25,"Well they -- a lot of people, you know, have asked me, and at the time, were, you know, demanding that we start ticketing and towing the vehicles out of that area in the neighbourhoods, and particularly on Wellington Street, but the reality is, until -- and you saw it on the last weekend when police moved in and started clearing the red zone, you need to secure the area where the actual physical truck is, protect it before you can bring the tow truck in and be able to move it out. You can't safely tow a heavy vehicle like that that's end-to-end, bumper to bumper with a whole bunch of other trucks, and civilian people and protesters are all around that truck, and you're trying to bring in a heavy truck, and police haven't been able to secure the scene. So until you can actually hopscotch your way down the street, push them back, clear the spot, get the truck out and move it and then keep moving in a systematic way, it's a very volatile, unsafe situation to bring in a tow truck into a very crowded area, expect people to move, and expect the tow trucker to somehow get in there and do their work when people are potentially going to be resisting the ability of the tow truck operator to do that. So police weren't able to -- obviously, they weren't able to clear that area and protect each individual truck, so the tow truck could get in. So it wasn't -- it was a non starter to be able to tow truck. Even if we had tow truck companies, we wanted to retain them to have them available for when police ultimately went in operationally or tactically, but it was a non starter until that happened for us to think about towing any heavy truck that was in the compressed areas on Wellington Street, some of the downtown streets where they were all bunched up.",03-042-27,42,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So the challenge for By-law was not towing and catching the wrong fish in the net and towing vehicles that you think are part of the protest who happen to just live in the area and park there. So it was a very complicated situation for By-law. They were ticketing. They were towing vehicles that were blocking the emergency lane in the red zone. They were clearing that out. And in the neighbourhoods, they were ticketing. They started ticketing, but there were also a lot of protest vehicles and people congregated in those side streets, and they were working with police to ensure the safety of our By-law officers.

I know people said -- well, there's a difference of opinion whether police directed By-law, or it was done in collaboration. Police can't direct By-law. Quite frankly, By-law can do what they need to do under they by-laws of the city, but we were working under an integrated incident management system, which basically, police are the incident commander. They're leading the response. The City is supporting and working in collaboration, and it was a reasonable request. Whether it was a direction or not is irrelevant to me, but when I heard that and I was advised of that, I said, that's reasonable not to expect By-law to go in on their own volition and enforce without police knowing that they're enforcing and creating a potentially volatile situation in a crowded area, which police would have to eventually respond to.

And so Wellington Street was an option, but it was understood that Wellington couldn't accommodate all the trucks from the neighbourhood as there just wasn't enough room. So part of the discussion was with some of them agreed to move to a site, I believe it was in the West End, Amprior or some other site they had, if they could go there. They wanted to get them on to SJAM, we didn't want them on SJAM, so there was discussion internally about the parameters of where they might go.

The two deputy chiefs, the acting and the -- Chief Bell and Acting Deputy Chief -- Deputy Chief Bell and Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson both expressed that they supported this because it would reduce the footprint and make it more manageable for their resources because they were spread too thin covering that large a geography.

And that they would be going out that night and working truck by truck, talking to everybody to get them in line -- or on line to support the movement because it was a good thing for them. And they also made it clear that not everybody will want -- some people may not want to go to that other alternate site, the farmer's area they rented. I think it was in Arnprior, but I don't remember. And that they wanted to extend the footprint of it more down to Deschamps, but we said no. And Rob Drummond was effectively leading those discussions in terms of where the trucks would go, how they'd be placed, and as I said, how that process would work in the morning, who'd be assigned out there from Ottawa Police. And so when we left the meeting, it was understood, we had a map of where the trucks would be moved, what areas we wanted to clear out, and Rob went back then to talk to his command and the NRCC and incident commanders to bring the resources required to be able to do that.

Eventually, that got sorted out and they did move a number of heavy trucks. I think the count was around 40, but that's still in dispute. And a number of light trucks also left, and we ended up clearing a number of streets. But, yeah, there was some communications issues, some logistical issues where some of them, my understanding was some of the light vehicles didn't want to move and were blocking other vehicles from moving, so there was -- there wasn't an alignment of purpose by everybody that was in -- on all those streets.

So, you know, I think it’s a fair assumption for me to make that Mr. Brookson was well informed in terms of what was happening on the ground from a situational awareness perspective and, you know, the bomb blast assessment, quite frankly, I’m not disregarding it, but it was a little late then. We already had hundreds of trucks up on Wellington Street to be concerned about moving another 40 trucks up there. So I -- you know, he -- that’s his role, to take care of the security of the Hill. And it’s an important role and I respect that. But at the time, I felt that Mr. Brookson, when he reached out to me, had the information, especially after he spoke to Chief Sloly. And I spoke to Chief Sloly after he had spoken to Mr. Brookson, and Chief Sloly advise me what the conversation was about, where he informed him what was happening. So I know there was some reporting, but I didn’t call him back. The events kind of overtook things on the 15th.

03-153-25,"All right. Good afternoon. My name is Brendan Miller. I'm counsel for Freedom Corp., which is a entity that represents the protesters that attended in Ottawa in January and February of 2022. Thank you for coming here today, sir. Sir, I just want to begin dealing with the issue with respect to the agreement that then went awry on February 14th and 15th and 16th; okay? So I first want to put to you a statement from one of your colleagues, Mr. Arpin, and I want to ask you if that is an accurate understanding of what he said. And I'm doing this to be fair to you because he's testifying next; right? So as I understand it, this is Mr. Arpin's evidence on that point, is that, ""On February 12th, 2022, an agreement was reached with the protesters who promised to remove 75 percent of the trucks in residential areas. Mr. Arpin had several conversations with Mr. French, including an in-person meeting to finalize the details of the agreement. Mr. Arpin spoke only with Mr. French and held no discussions with protestors. The mayor did not take part in the discussions between Mr. French and Mr. Arpin. Per the agreement, some vehicles would be relocated to Wellington Street. The City's understanding was that some protesters wanted to leave entirely, and the others would relocate to sites outside the city (for instance, Vankleek Hill). According to the City, it was understood that the agreement was not a permanent solution, but it was nevertheless considered a short- term victory for residents overwhelmed by the protest. On February 13th, 2022, some senior members of the Ottawa Police Service, including Chief Peter Sloly, the Deputy Chief Steve Bell and Superintendent Rob Drummond were advised of the content of the agreement. They shared no concern about the plan. Furthermore, during the meeting with some senior OPS members, they stated that the agreement could ease tensions with the protesters and increase the police's capacity to respond since they would have a smaller footprint to manage. Also, it was Mr. Arpin's understanding that the Superintendent Drummond took part in a meeting where he was involved in elaborating the plan's details with Mr. K..."" (As read) And I'll call you that. I'll butcher pronouncing it. ""...a meeting in which Mr. Arpin was not involved. According to Mr. Arpin, there was no doubt that Deputy Chief Bell and Superintendent Drummond were aware that a number of vehicles would be added to Wellington Street. Chief Sloly was advised of the agreement during a meeting, whose attendees included Kim Ayotte, General Manager of the City's Emergency and Protective Services and Mr. K. He also received by email a copy of the letter from Mayor Watson to the convoy organizers confirming the agreement. The agreement was announced to council members that day. On February 14th, 2022, the protesters began moving the trucks with the support of OPS. In the afternoon, according to information provided to Mr. Arpin and for reasons unknown to him, the OPS ended the operation. It was his understanding that approximately 102 vehicles (roughly 25 percent of the vehicles) had been moved in the meantime, including approximately 40 heavy trucks.""

03-187-17,"Yeah, well, they -- to answer that, you have to put it in the context of the way our incident management is structured in the city and is best practiced through the Solicitor General's guidebook on dealing with emergencies of Ontario. And effectively, you have an incident commander who deals with an incident. If the incident grows larger and that commander needs more support, you'll start scaling up your emergency operations. And what ended up happening in this situation is that you have an incident commander. The National Capital Regional Command Centre then was formed because we had multiple jurisdictions and multiple law enforcement entities that were engaged in the event. And so the incident commander had the National Capital Regional Command Centre as a support function to help the lead, which was Ottawa Police, be able to enact all the things they needed to enact on the ground. And flowing down from that would be command centres at Ottawa Police, command centres at the City of Ottawa, which we called our Emergency Operations Centre, the EOC, and other organizations would have the same, which when requests came from the incident commander through the National Capital Regional Command Centre, it'd go down into the -- for instance, the City of Ottawa, the EOC, and the EOC would make sure that what they needed was actually actioned in the departments or the service areas. And each one of those service areas stood up its own departmental command centre, so they can coordinate all the efforts, because these aren't things that we do on the corner of our desk.

Now, you discussed earlier the authority that the City uses to close roads. And so I want to draw the second paragraph of this letter to your attention and then ask you to explain the approach that was taken. This letter, of course, is in respect to the Rolling Thunder Convoy, which postdates the Freedom Convoy. And so Mr. Ayotte says to Interim Chief Bell: “In light of the information that the City has been provided with respect to the proposed rally, including the intelligence that OPS has shared with staff, the City remains of the view that the use of vehicles in the Rolling Thunder Ottawa 2022 rally will have [a] significant [impact] on the orderly movement of traffic in the City and could pose a serious potential for injury or damage to persons or property. As a result, in addition to traffic measures along the motorcycle route, the City and OPS have jointly agreed on the necessity of restricting vehicular traffic in the designated downtown core area.” So can you just explain the approach to road closures here?",03-194-07,194,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

03-195-05,"Well the Rolling Thunder was -- obviously had the benefit of learning from the protests we had in February. And at that time, we’d started discussing, as we were planning for that, what authorities we had to be able to close the roads. And Interim Chief Bell and myself had a conversation about exercising that authority to close the roads. We got legal opinion at that time in terms of what our authorities were, what were the actual statutes and bylaws that allowed us to do it, and Kim Ayotte was brought into the discussion, and based on the information that was shared with us by Ottawa Police with respect to what they were expecting for Rolling Thunder, we made the decision that we would create a no-go zone, basically a red zone, for the inner core to prevent vehicles from permanently taking route. So we changed, as I said, sort of the snake march example. We changed our tactics based on the learnings that we had from that event in February, and it was quite an effective strategy.",03-195-07,195,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

The City Manager approached the mayor and myself. We had a brief discussion in the foyer of the mayor's office. I think it was around 5:30 p.m. that day, asking us for our views on this proposal. My initial reaction and my advice to the mayor is that it was extraordinary -- it was an extraordinary request. We would normally not take part in such a meeting. We were not aware of the individuals. We had no dealings with those individuals. We had no history of reliability. And hence, we - - I made the recommendation. The major accepted the recommendation that we would not take part in the meeting, but the City Manager was free to proceed with the meeting if he felt it would be beneficial to better understand the concerns, issues and demands of the truck convoy protest. And my understanding is he proceeded to grant that meeting on the 8th. And he informed us thereafter that he felt it had been a constructive meeting. He felt that the parties were speaking reliably. We had no knowledge of whether or not they represented a large cross-section of truckers, but they appeared to be dealing in good faith with the City Manager and the PLT team. It's also our understanding from the City Manager that the PLT team had suggested that we engage with the truck convoy representatives on their willingness to initially move some trucks out of the residential district as a sign of good will. My understanding is that the City Manager did explore that concept with the representatives early on. That was shared with us post facto. On or around February 10th, the mayor received a called from Dean French, saying that he was willing to play a good will role as an ambassador between the two parties. He appeared to be seeking no gain or personal benefit. We knew him from his time of Chief of Staff to Premier Ford, had had what I could call a professional, courteous and friendly relationship with him. We felt he was a straight shooter in our dealings with him in the past. And so the mayor asked me to call him back and see whether or not a -- there was any potential for any kind of an agreement that would help relieve the extraordinary stress that our residents were under in the residential districts.",03-202-29,202,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And so my understanding is that the purpose of your discussions, and we'll focus on your discussions with Mr. French, as we've already heard Steve K's testimony, the purpose of those discussions was to find a solution that would kind of relieve some of the stresses on the residents of the downtown core; is that correct?",03-204-18,204,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

03-204-22,"The context of the moment -- and just to back up a bit, we have never in 11 years and 11 months since the mayor's election in 2010, been involved in negotiations with any group in the context of a demonstration. That's extraordinary. And we would not have involved ourselves had the PLT team not approached the City Manager and sought the City and the mayor's involvement in such a dialogue, it's extraordinary, you would normally not do it. The context was the -- you know, we're into about Day 9 or 10 of the -- what has -- was initially going to be a demonstration has become an occupation of our residential districts. Residents, shut-ins, you know, residents from all walks of life were feeling threatened in their personal safety and security, and the Mayor was living that every single day, he took it home very single day. He was working 15 to 18 hours a day. Yes, he was looking for any solution that might help us alleviate the pressure on our residents, and what they were going through. And for us, it appeared that there was no downside for us to undertake this dialogue, as there was no end in sight. There appeared to be no, you know, cogent, you know, multi-jurisdictional plan to bring this thing to an end. And so if we were able to get one truck out of the residential district it would be a, you know, a small victory. That wasn't our goal, of course, but the intent was to alleviate the pressure short- term. And we were told by various parties, including the City Manager, including Steve Bell, including Kim Ayotte that the short-term goal was to bring the temperature down with the demonstrators, since the relationship broke -- had broken down with the PLT team, and bringing them into a small perimeter would also help the OPS and the combined forces potentially when they bring the demonstration under greater control, if not to a halt.",03-204-24,204,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

03-206-24,"As you know, we're already 10 days into the crisis, with horns blaring and, you know, heavy trucks spewing diesel into a number of residential streets in the core, at Rideau and Sussex, at Coventry, and Overbrook- Forbes. Our goal from the get-go was to get a sense of their willingness to recognise through Mr. French that they were hurting local communities, and if there was no agreement on that notion then there was nothing to discuss. We wanted to, you know, get a point very, very quickly of understanding of whether or not he could get the key organisers to recognise that they never intended to hurt, you know, ordinary people in residential districts. And that became apparent quite quickly in our first few discussions, and we -- you know, we laid out a couple of ideas. Some of them had come directly from the PLT team. Because again, as you would know, and as I mentioned to you earlier, I cannot recall us ever being involved in a discussion with a group of demonstrators directly, it would not happen. And so we -- you know, we sought to establish some perimeters, and they included, you know, a sense from them of their willingness to remove a large number of trucks from the residential district, and we set out a number, 75 percent, below which we felt we would not be providing any relief to the residents who were under, essentially, you know, what they viewed as siege and what we concurred with as being a siege of their day-to-day. So it had to be a big number. We wanted to see rapid progress on the removal of trucks because we would find out very, very quickly if this was a stunt or if it was a bluff to try to, you know, gain more time, or -- and we found out that it wasn't a stunt. We believed that -- sorry. We set out those perimeters of roughly 75 percent, rapid movement towards, you know, moving the trucks from the residential district, and we rapidly came to a -- you know, an understanding in principle. I wrote something up, I sent it to Dean, which was going to be the Mayor's opening position around this is what we need for us to have a dialogue, and to commit to a potential meeting, a listening meeting with Mayor Watson.

And so it -- we started getting bogged down in who would go where, and when realised that that was futile because we had no clear understanding of what proportion of trucks would end up going where. The general dialogue, after I consulted with the City Manager's Office and with Kim Ayotte, had a discussion with because this was, again, at the urging of the PLT team, they asked that we engage in this dialogue, and they recommended that we talk about reducing the number of trucks in the residential district. We set forth a framework that would have them go into a smaller perimeter. I consulted with Mr. Ayotte. I think I remember him saying that there was room for, you know, a significant number of large trucks as long as they parked in a more compact fashion in that broad, broad perimeter of Elgin, Wellington, and west of that. And obviously we're in the middle of the pandemic. Most of those buildings were empty at that point in time. We expected that if there were significant operational concerns the City would have raised that with us in the last stretch of those discussions, in the last 48 hours, as the City was liaising with OPS and other police forces. And so, no, there was no explicit -- it wasn't like a -- the handshake was not predicated on every single truck will go to Wellington because then if they had moved trucks to Vankleek Hill or Arnprior, then it would have been seen as being outside of the agreement.

And, you know, Twitter, social media, media outlets, et cetera, were saying, “We’re not seeing anything. We’re not seeing additional officers. We’re not seeing additional mobilization.” And so our data, what was being provided to us, was completely inconsistent with what OPS was relaying to us. And you’ll note that in a very, very lengthy and detailed exchange with the Chair of OPSB, you know, we’re having an exchange about the numbers, asking them if it’s taking too long to swear people in, which was a suggestion coming from Mike, that there could be, you know, various delays; we understood that. But we would go back to OPS and say, “Well, you know, what are you seeing? How many officers are you getting? Are you seeing this surge of, you know, 250 officers?” And the answer was, “No.” It was a -- and it wasn’t 10 shy of 250; it was 200 shy, it was 180 shy.

It was intended to be fluid in nature. And we immediately, you know, within an hour or two of issuing the letter, we got a call from the local councillor saying, ""Does this mean we'll see a lot more trucks on the parkway?"" And the answer was no. In the letter, if you read it, again, I think literally it shows from Elgin to the Sir John A MacDonald Parkway. Obviously, it wasn't intended to bring parks out to -- trucks out to the Chaudière Falls. That's how far you could go. You could go very, very far. You could go to Champlain Bridge on the Sir John.

As I have mentioned earlier, I have served Mayor Watson for 11 years, and 11 months, through the totality of his current mandate as post amalgamation mayor. He has never made request to a politician, an elected official, a minister, a solicitor general for police officers. We've made requests for funding, which are within Council's mandate, but the Mayor has never been engaged in seeking support from another level of government for a specific number of additional bodies. I shared that with the Chair. They provided me with a draft of what -- a letter they thought should go to the Premier and -- the Prime Minister and the Premier. We redrafted it. I recommended to the Mayor that it not be sent. We had a good discussion around it, and after I shared with the Mayor the fact that the Chair had said that the OPS would not be securing these resources without her involvement, that they were unsuccessful, in other words, I have to presume that they were being told, ""No, you're not getting these additional bodies"", and then she sent us a draft. We rewrote it. I sent it to her. Sorry, she sent us a draft I think at 9:00 a.m. on February 7th, that should be in record, I think I've seen it. At 12 o'clock, we sent her a new draft that identified both I think Minister Mendicino and Com Blair, and the Premier of Ontario and the Solicitor General as the people we'd be writing too providing a broader context for the scope and scale of the crisis that residents were being subjected to, seeking, you know, an additional number of bodies, which that number was provided to us by the OPS, and the Mayor relented and agreed to sign those two letters.

It sounded like to a layperson that the absence of that agreement might have been holding things up. Had we known earlier, you know, we would have sat down with the City Manager, with Kim, with the Chief of Police to get an understanding of what we were told for the first time 13, 14 days into the crisis that there was no agreement on an Integrated Planning Structure. That was extraordinarily frustrating for us to hear that. Because we're there -- normally, we try to help. We're there to try to fix things and get things resolved, and obviously, we don't have all the inputs if we're -- you know, we don't have the entire picture of that command structure not coming together until almost two weeks after the start of the demonstration.",03-258-12,258,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

The logistical challenge of moving those trucks out is nothing short of a Rubik's cube without their cooperation. The same applies if you start from the back."" (As read) And it then goes on.

The mayor was so skeptical that he said, you know, let's set up a call for the 16th, which I did. In the meantime, it is my job to anticipate any required motions that the mayor and members of Council might meet as the situation is emerging from a governance or any other perspective that creates risks for Ottawa residents, Ottawa taxpayers, that might have influence on public confidence in our city and in our institutions. And the Mayor felt, after having been -- having had the confirmation from Chair Deans that he was very, very skeptical that this was proceeding, that this hiring was proceeding, the third Chief in 24 hours, he was so skeptical that he said, ""Do what you want. Prepare for a motion, if you need to. I don't believe it, I need to hear it from my own -- on my own."" The call was set up, but in the morning, a pre-emptive meeting was set up for the purpose of preparing a motion should the confirmation come forward that a new Chief had been hired at the height of the truck convoy insurrection, which the Mayor disagreed with. He felt it would demoralise our troops significantly, he thought it was a very bad error in judgement.

Mr. Arpin, one of the things you mentioned was evidence of -- that trucks had moved, so I just want to take you to some photos and have you identify them for the Commissioner.

03-328-09,"After the agreement had been concluded over the weekend of February 12th we sought from the City manager's office through Kim Ayotte, could he help us get an understanding of whether or not any trucks were being moved out of the residential precinct because people who were not in the precinct were reporting on the issue. We had no way of finding out whether or not trucks were moving. And I asked him if there was a way to get that information in the morning. Obviously, there was a huge amount of pressure on the Mayor, on all members of Council, on the City at large to get some progress. And by around 10, 11 o’clock, as we were having no success in getting any basic intel, I would ask Mr. Ayotte, “Can you tell me how many trucks are moving?” And he would say, “Well, 12 trucks have moved.” And I said, “Only 12 trucks?” Well, he said, “I’m not sure, people are sending me text messages from the field.” Okay, great. But we sent an employee of our office to take pictures that morning because there was just so much politics going around in relation to the removal of trucks, and these pictures will show that there are large swots of the downtown core that were being cleared, and notwithstanding the Rubik’s cube that had been described. Well, clearly they got Truck A to move, and Truck B, and C, D, E, F, G, and from what we could tell from photos from the media from before, there were 25-30 trucks in the precinct. Mr. Ayotte contacted me, I think maybe around noon, saying, “Well, unfortunately we only moved 40 trucks.” And I said, “Well, from the photographic evidence, there seems to have been a lot, lot more that were removed.” And then he came back to me, saying, “I’m sorry, apparently the people doing the count were only counting big rigs.” So, you know, the mid-size, delivery vans, the CANPAR type vehicle, the small Duravan type vehicle was not being counted. That’s all I can say. We had poor intel. He had poor intel. The Mayor was being asked, being bombarded on media, “This is failing.” From what we could tell, from the amount of time that they had to move trucks, if someone was stopping it, it could not be discerned from what we were provided in terms of intel.

The perimeter to be managed was extraordinary, and you may recall that when OPS, in conjunction with OPP and the RCMP in the week of February 16th, I believe, when we started to see the mobilization and the erection of a new perimeter that went all the way from Elgin, Wellington, all the way down to Catherine Street, all the way down to Bronson and North, back up to Parliament, you know, I think that’s when we started to get a greater sense of the magnitude of the perimeter that would have to be controlled and defended to remove them, and then ensure that they don’t come back and forth. And I believe that once the cooperation started, which the Mayor sought, and was thankful to both the Province and the Feds for engaging when they did, belatedly; everyone engaged belatedly and imperfectly.

That was at the start. The Chief of Police was telling us, the Charter rights, he told the Mayor -- the Mayor has no authority to overrule the Chief of Police on police operations. He told the Mayor, the Charter dictates that we allow this demonstration. Clearly we have learned, all -- everyone, the City, OPS, our partners have learned that the world of policing has changed, and this ended up being almost an immovable armada.

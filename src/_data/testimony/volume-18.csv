We were watching what was happening in Ottawa and we know -- anyone who lives in Windsor knows and appreciates how important the Ambassador Bridge is, not just for our local and regional economies, but also provincially. And so over the weekend we started making preparations to acquire jersey barriers, at the request of police. I had made an effort to secure one of our Transit Windsor buses to put on the -- let’s say the other side of customs, on the duty-free side of the tunnel, just in case there was a blockage at the bridge and the tunnel, because there were -- there was the thought that you could have the closure of both pieces of infrastructure. And we knew that we had to provide a mechanism to move health -- move healthcare workers who lived in Windsor and worked in Detroit. We had to be able to get them through the tunnel, even if their cars could not get through the tunnel. And so we moved a transit bus to the other side, to the duty-free plaza in the tunnel, and then there was -- there was work being done to figure out how to move that bus through, because we were still in this COVID restriction period, and there were ArriveCAN and all sorts of restrictions crossing back and forth through the international border. So work was going on, on that front as well. So everyone was working very well together, dealing with whatever information we had and trying to provide and prepare for the eventual -- you know, the eventuality in the worst-case scenario, which would be the closure of Huron Church Road, leading to the Ambassador Bridge.",18-029-23,29,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

18-059-01,"Well, I was. And on February the 9th, you know, in the -- in sort of the mid to late afternoon, I'd had a conversation with our Commissioner of Legal Services, Shelby Askin Hager, you know, about the prospect of an injunction. And she wanted to think through it and make sure she understood the best way to move forward with that idea. And then on the 10th, in the morning, we had to move quickly if we were going to make that happen. And so I said, ""We need to do this."" And the reason for doing this was -- there were multiple reasons. What people need to appreciate is that not just the temperature on the ground of the protesters, but the temperature of the general public to this protest was amplifying as well, and I could not as mayor, I could not as Chair of the Windsor Police Services Board direct police operations and tell the Chief or the police administration how to move forward and when to move forward. I had no clear line of sight on how many resources were coming here. I knew there -- you know, I'm getting dribs and drabs of, you know, yes, some folks are en route. Well, are they en route from Alberta? Are they en route from Newfoundland? Are they coming from Orillia? I have no sense of the timing. And so the public temperature to this protest was also growing rapidly, to the point where you had Facebook groups being set up where people wanted to go out and undertake sort of vigilante type justice on the streets to remove these protesters themselves. And it was -- as it relates to, you know, the pandemic that we'd all lived through, in Windsor, we had lived through the same thing that many others have lived through, the stops and the starts of businesses, people not getting paid for a period of time, and going through that frustration and friction as we've all dealt with the pandemic collectively. And so just when we were at a point where there seemed to be, you know, light on the horizon, this was seen to be very, how do I say it, assaultive to many people in Windsor that this was a small group of people, a relatively small group of people who were now going to jeopardize their employment. And so you had, like I said, Facebook groups that were starting where people were suggesting, and union leadership suggesting they were going to -- they were prepared to help move the protesters themselves and take action themselves. And so part of the reason for applying for the injunction was to send a signal to the public that I'm doing everything -- that the City is doing everything, that City Council is doing everything we can from our side of the table to try and resolve this issue. It was really the only positive step I could think of taking that would be helpful in terms of a signal to the public. Before I did this, I did talk to the Chief and said, ""Would this be helpful to you?"" And she said, ""Listen, it won't hurt."" And so on the morning of the 10th, very early, we activated legal teams to start putting the materials together, trying to see if we could get a scheduled appointment in court to present the application. And I worked with our Commissioner of Legal Services and our City Manager and all of the right people on the City side to see that move forward very quickly. And so, you know, the conversation really was first thing in the morning, seven or eight o'clock in the morning, and by two o'clock, we were appearing in front of Justice Morawetz to have this discussion.",18-059-03,59,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

In the first 60 minutes of Huron Church Road being blocked, our phone rang at the mayor's office from our largest employer, Chrysler, or now Stellantis, to say, ""What's going on at the Ambassador Bridge?"" You know, there are 5,000 people directly who work in that facility making Chrysler Pacificas and minivans that rely on smooth and efficient border crossings because the whole industry, the whole auto industry works on a just in time basis. There's no parts being stored on site. They are brought in, and that bridge is moving, and the material's moving across that bridge every hour of every day. And so it's -- you know, for perspective, the average part that goes into a car that rolls off the assembly line at the end of the manufacturing process, those parts have crossed the border on average six to seven times, back and forth, Detroit back to Windsor, you know, as they continue to be, you know, upgraded and built. And so within the first 60 minutes, they called and said, ""What's going on at the Ambassador Bridge?"" And so we knew that the APMA, the Automotive Parts Manufacturer's Association, the CVMA, the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers Association were impacted dramatically by the activity at the bridge.

All parties had a chance to do that. And Chief Justice Morawetz ultimately made his decision that was favourable to grant the injunction, but everybody had an opportunity. In fact, our application on February 10th was delayed and heard on February 11th to ensure that all parties, including the protestors, were given notice so that they could participate.

18-075-05,"Well, I think, you know, we all know that that Act has never been used before, and we all know that it's a serious Act and requires this type of thing to happen afterwards, which is extraordinary. And so if they were going to move forward with that, I think he's saying, you know, ""if you could express"" -- the way I took that is ""if you could express what was happening on the ground that would help justify this, that would be helpful to us."" And I think it's really, really important, you know, to reflect on that statement, but also use that statement based on what we were seeing on the ground in Windsor. And so there may have been some great relief, and there was great relief to a lot of people in Windsor on the 13th. Once the folks were moved, all of a sudden, you know, in lightening speed 1,100 jersey barriers were replaced, 6 kilometres of jersey barriers, creating a direct pipeline from the 401 to the Ambassador Bridge. But the piece that needs to be explained here is the heightened state of alert that was in place by police in the community and the city with respect to sort of some sort of recidivism that may happen as a result of this blockade being moved. And it's the type of behaviour that's happened throughout the pandemic, where you have members of the public in Windsor saying, you know, ""There's a protest. We're all supposed to be masked metres apart from one another, and there's a protest and a hundred people down, you know, by our great Canadian flag at the waterfront. Why aren't police doing anything? Why is that behaviour being allowed to continue?"" And it's hard to explain to people that if you move hundred people out and take action against these sort of lawbreakers or rulebreakers that you could have three thousand the next weekend. You know, you become the rallying cry for this. And so that was the thought in place here. From a police perspective, the conversations that we certainly had amongst many of the senior staff and myself and the City is, you know, ""This action needs to be resolved. This action needs to be taken to resolve the situation on the ground, but what happens after they're gone?"" And so the number of police that were sent to the City of Windsor to move the protesters out was one thing, but a significant number of police resources remained in order to make sure that this didn't flare up again. And so from an Emergencies Act perspective, you know, anything that would send a signal to people contemplating coming to Windsor to start this over again, I thought, from my chair, was extremely helpful to send a signal. You had the City declare an emergency, the Province declared an emergency, and then the Federal Government declared an emergency, and I think that sent -- ought to have sent a signal to a lot of people that this is serious matter and will not be allowed to happen again.",18-075-07,75,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

18-077-09,"Yes, thank you for asking that question. So what happened is we had had a Council meeting prior to me signing off on the declaration of Emergency on the 14th. One of the concerns that Council had generally was, there was a portion of the resolution in front of Council that provided wide latitude to the City Manager to do a number of things that Council didn’t feel comfortable giving sort of carte blanche to the City Manager at that particular time. And we’re talking about acquiring resources or moving transit routes; like, City operational type stuff. That I said, “Well, don’t worry. If you have a concern with that, let’s not get held up with that. I’ll declare the emergency, which then would wrap that authority up in me -- to me, and anything that’s required with respect to dealing with this direct pipeline that’s been created, I’ll have the ability to deal with.

18-078-20,"Well, you know, I felt like that wasn’t going to provide anything new that I needed at the time. So we didn’t have -- like, police were telling me what they needed; I was trying to amplify their requests from a City perspective. And with respect to Public Works and jersey barriers and all the things that we had to mobilize, no-one came to me saying, “We can’t do this,” or, “They’re charging us 10 times the amount.” Nothing -- nothing would have benefited. I can’t see the situation becoming better because I signed it at that particular time. What happened on the 14th, though, when everyone woke up and they saw this tunnel from the 401 to the Ambassador Bridge in both directions, if you live in Windsor, you know that that was, like, a major, major thing. All cross traffic was blocked, bus routes were rerouted; there were going to be impacts on business, many businesses, over 200 businesses that were, you know, impacted as a result of that particular action. And, again, that wasn’t something that was my decision; that was a police decision to put these jersey barriers in place and create a safe pipeline to and from the bridge. So I anticipated that there would be some requirement to deal very, very quickly on the municipal side with stuff that we deal with operationally, but that tool would have given me the benefit of acting quickly. And so that’s why I did it on the 14th as opposed to do it earlier, because I didn’t see the need to do it earlier.",18-078-22,78,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

18-084-22,"Well, this is a -- the Ambassador Bridge and the City of Windsor is a unique circumstance. So you have, as I said, the Ambassador Bridge, the busiest commercial border crossing between the United States and Canada, which is privately owned, that sits at one end of the municipal roadway, and three kilometres on the other end is a provincial highway. And so, you know, the 401 is a roadway where there are no traffic lights. It's sort of barrier free. But as soon as you get off onto Huron Church Road, you're on that municipal road, which falls under the responsibility and authority of the City of Windsor and the Windsor Police Service. You have six or seven traffic lights, so trucks as they make their way from the 401 to the Ambassador Bridge have to go through those series of municipal traffic lights. And it is a unique situation that you have, you know, a provincial highway at one end, a municipal roadway linking what I would suggest is sort of important federal infrastructure. And so my request to them, to the other levels of government was we need to sit down and figure this out. We need to figure out in the event that something like this were to happen again, how do we respond and, you know, sort of pull the template off the shelf that the response is seamless, that it's not, you know, a day or two here trying to figure out how many folks we need, and who's going to do what, and who should take the lead, and then ultimately, who's paying for it. You know, so the City of Windsor has carried all of the water. We're paying all of the bills, $5.3 million for the, you know, execution of this particular police action, which was absolutely necessary, but I would submit is completely unfair that the City of Windsor is shouldering those costs. It was not a typical municipal policing matter. In fact, it was a national, economic emergency. And we responded appropriately. The Windsor Police did a great job. The OPP did a great job. The RCMP, they all worked very well together, but we need to figure this out moving forward because the Ambassador Bridge is not going away, our municipal road's not going away and the 401 is not going away. So what does this look like in the future, and that was my request to them is to sit down and try and figure out how we do this together in the future to eliminate any sort of delays that might be inherent in the way we moved in February.",18-084-24,84,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

18-086-13,"Well, it was, you know, almost immediate. Again, within the first hour, our largest employer called saying, ""What's going on?"" The very next day, on February the 8th, they suspended some of their manufacturing operations and it was intermittent during the week of the blockade. We also had part suppliers that basically stopped producing parts because they had nowhere to send them, and they don't stockpile large quantity of parts. And, you know, there was a huge, huge impact in the auto sector. But don't forget, even on -- in Essex County, you know, City of Windsor is plus or minus 230,000 people. If we take the neighbouring county, and we're part of that county, just not part of their government, it's about 450,000 people total in that area. We have the largest greenhouse operation in North America, second in the world next to Holland. And so a full 80 percent of all greenhouses in Canada are in Essex County. And so the produce that is produced in those facilities that operate 24/7 365, the vast majority of it is exported to the United States through the Ambassador Bridge. And so the regional impact, which we cannot discount, was material. It was major. And, you know, having folks idle, having plants idle is not good just for our economy. It also had an impact on the U.S. side because of the integration of our supply chains. And so that's why we had folks from the United States, you know, senior leaders in the United States calling for an end to this as well and trying to push for a resolution because it was impacting their economy too.",18-086-15,86,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And so this was me sending a signal, to the extent that any of those folks were watching, that we understand that this has to end, that we understand that you have a choice in terms of where you locate these facilities, and that we're doing all we can to try and move folks on. And that sort of plays into the whole injunction piece as well, that it's the public-facing part of it was that important, as was it important to make sure police had another tool that they could use. But I wanted to make sure that with respect to the folks, you know, early on here, we're in the very early part of sort of rolling out all of the pieces back in February for this major, major investment, I wanted to make sure that they knew very clearly that we were very -- taking this situation very seriously and applying all resources that we could from a municipal perspective to get this situation resolved, reflecting on the fact that, you know, did I think that the first Ford factory in Canada, 1904, I didn't think a 100-year or 120-year relationship was going to be eviscerated because of a 7-day event.

18-090-14,"Well, major. And so let me mention several. When this all started, EMS had to move an ambulance to the other side of Huron Church. They had to make sure that they could cover that part of the city. Our fire chief moved and deployed fire resources. There’s a fire station literally 100 metres from where the protestors were protesting, but it’s on the east side of Huron Church. They moved a truck to the west side to make sure that they could provide -- that they could get there and provide service to the west side of the city. The transit routes were disrupted. The natural flow of people back and forth and having Huron Church Road closed was significant because there are no grocery stores on one side of -- on the west side of Huron Church. They’re all on the east side. And a lot of folks have to take the bus. They don’t have their own car on the other side of -- the west side of Huron Church, and so they require the city system to be able to move around and live their daily lives. The University of Windsor. The University of Windsor is directly adjacent to Huron Church, directly adjacent to the Ambassador Bridge. The primary route that people in the City of Windsor would use to get to the University of Windsor is Huron Church Road. So 17,500 students that attend the University of Windsor. You have a high school that was actually in the protest zone, Assumption High School. It’s been there for probably 100 years. And so that school was directly impacted by the protest activity. And I mean, just -- those are just -- those are several, but the impact was material during the protest and then even after the protest because of the deployment of the jersey barriers along Huron Church Road had a direct impact to the hotels, the motels, the businesses, the small businesses, large businesses, grocery stores. You name it, they were impacted, including the high school, including the University of Windsor because everyone had to find another way around.",18-090-16,90,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

18-165-18,"Well, because of the construct of the roadways and the infrastructure that exists going back 90 years, it really is imperative that we have a three-pronged approach here. Every level of government has a role to play. The City has to be an equal partner, and the City, respectfully, plays a disproportionate role in trying to resolve some of these issues, like the issue we're talking about in February, that we need to have these things coordinated in advance, have the conversation worked out in advance so we know who's doing what and who's responsible to fund some of these costs. And so after the fact, trying to get payment of over $5 million is -- it's frustrating to be honest, but, you know, we need to have these things worked out. And the response that we provided during the, let's say the week of -- the primary week of activity, all we did is respond. You know, we responded, we -- if it were the jersey barriers, someone said they're $1.3 million. ""How fast can you get them here?"" was the answer. We wanted to be as responsive as possible. But you know, from a City perspective there is a disproportionate burden, and so hosting an international crossing like this presents some opportunities for the City from an economic development perspective, but it also puts a disproportionate burden on the residents in the City of Windsor. Whether it's noise and air pollution, you know, whether it's, you know, traffic congestion on municipal roads and having to fund the costs of some of these municipal roads that fund truck traffic to an international crossing, all of these things, we really needed to sit down. And the point of this letter was ""Let's sit down in advance. This may happen again, it may not happen again, but it's probably worth a few hours of discussion to figure out how we're going to do this moving forward so that it is -- you know, pull it from the shelf and implement as opposed to trying to figure it out in real time.""",18-165-20,165,20,18,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

18-172-14,"Yes, Commissioner. Eric Brousseau, Commission Counsel for the record. Before we call the next witness, I just want to formally table the bulk entry list from last week, which some may have noticed was not tabled. The list being entered today was first circulated on October 24th. We asked parties for their objections by 5:00 p.m. on November 1st. Commission Counsel received those objections, removed those doc IDs from the list. And the final list consists of 250 documents identified by Commission Counsel working on the police aspect of the Commission's mandate, as with the prior lists, emails, plans, a number of documents which we did not have time to put to the witnesses. And as well, there were 92 documents identified by Commission Counsel working on the protester aspect of the Commission's mandate, largely documents produced by the convoy organisers group, but other Commissioned documents OPS, JCF, and a few other parties. So those now will be sort of formally tagged and marked as exhibits. And I also just want to speak very briefly about the process for resolving the objections, which the parties were advised of this morning. Going forward, Commission Counsel will be using a revised template to send out the document IDs each week. We will continue to give a week's sort of notice and opportunity to review the documents. By five p.m. the following Monday, we will ask for the parties to put their objections in writing within that Excel spreadsheet. We will, as Commission Counsel, put them together and then try to deal with them directly with the party who has objected, and if not, Commission Counsel will embed their responses within that sheet, which will then be up to you, Commissioner, to sort of make a decision on the admissibility. The default will be that it will be done in writing, so parties are being encouraged to put their submissions as fulsomely as they would like in that Excel. Oral hearings will be sort of exceptional, subject to your discretion. This is the process which we will use starting today, for this week's bulk entry. And at some point, we will communicate a timeline for dealing with all of the objections, which have accrued to date. And so I just wanted to put that on the record.

They still didn’t explain how they would do it, how it would be done and what we could do to stop it. I think what we really were thinking at the time, this bearhug idea. If you can recall the geography of the bridge, it’s essentially the road is a circle around the entire bridge property.

Again, the problem we ran into was how? How are we going to -- how are they going to block the bridge? We had no intelligence. Again, the geography of the bridge is very porous; it’s critical infrastructure in the middle of our west- end, with side streets and access to the bridge, exits to the bridge; it’s not as easy as a one-way-in, one-way-out.

I can't tell you times or days, but there was numerous times where lanes were opened and closed, but essentially it was PLT doing that for us. They had also brought in a couple of minor tactics with printed pieces of paper for officers and their notebook for common messaging handouts for the protesters.

18-202-16,"So if I could just back up to the Monday. One of my first questions was, again, when it comes down to lessons from Ottawa, knowing that the tow truck companies did not want to participate with the Ottawa Police or help them that was one of my first questions. Are -- we have a contract with the company in Windsor, and my -- to Inspector Crosby, I remember asking her, are they onboard? And she said she already had asked that question, and they were. So that was good news to us. And that first night, again, the -- we were trying to keep protesters off of private property and Assumption High School is, as the Mayor said, right in the protest area on Huron Church, between Tecumseh and College. We started seeing protest vehicles go into the school property parking lot, and we went over there to discuss with them to, you know, ""You're not welcome here. We've already talked to the Board, you're not welcome, it's time to go."" And we kind of gave them an ultimatum, saying, ""Listen, you have 10, 15 minutes to move. We're going to tow you."" So we held the tow trucks back out of sight as best we could, again, not wanting to escalate things, you know, and somebody spotted one of the tow trucks. And we had some altercations, or sorry, not altercations, some of the protesters came out of their cars with tire irons, and we were at times, not only on this occasion but almost outnumbered in getting swarmed a little bit, and again, having our officers have to disengage to not escalate. So then they ended up moving after some negotiation. But that was the Assumption High School incident.",18-202-18,202,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

So we did not want to give any kind of, you know, spot for the protesters to basically congregate. Essentially right there at Tecumseh Road, we have very large parking lots, there is a grocery store and numerous a mall essentially, so it's a very big parking lot.

18-204-23,"So we had carried through with the plan that we had talked about with trying to control the intersection of College and Huron Church, which is the first intersection south of the entrance to the bridge. And what we did we established control of it with traffic officers, our traffic enforcement officers, by basically just letting two or three cars go at a time, and if they went on the bridge and crossed then we'd let another two or three. So that's how we controlled for quite a while, actually. Same with coming off the bridge, we would try and do that best we can -- we could. And then I think doing that for sometime, it was frustrating. The protesters, again we were listening to open source media, and they were getting frustrated with us. So I think the comment was one of them basically said, ""I wonder what happens if I just stop my truck right here in the southbound lanes?"" And that's what happened. Best truck stopped, a pickup truck stopped, I would say 200, 300 metres south of College, another one stopped and another stopped, and the next thing you know all three lanes were blocked, and that's how it started. So from there, the traffic started to block up or clog up very quickly, and within probably 20 minutes there was a line of semi-trucks that were just regular commuters for industry creating a line of trucks miles into Detroit and Michigan. So that's how it started.",18-204-25,204,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,DEPUTY CHIEF JASON CROWLEY,deputy chief jason crowley

18-205-25,"so the why would be, you know, people were stuck on this bridge for hours. The bridge is almost a hundred years old. So we were worried about structural integrity of the bridge. We were worried about commerce. We were worried about people having no, you know, food, water, you know, washrooms, being up on the bridge. We wanted to get that bridge cleared off. So the how was very difficult. So, again, the geography of the bridge, there's one main entrance that comes out onto Huron Church Road, which is southbound. There is a secondary entrance -- or exit, sorry. If I said entrance the first time, I meant exit. There's a secondary exit that turns to the west and goes up a small road, part of Huron Church beside the bridges towards Wyandotte. And then the only other access to the bridge is off of Wyandotte Street. It's an entrance. So at that point, again, very dynamic. There was blockages at all three at times. So we were -- at points, we were using an entrance on the north side of the bridge for exiting. We were trying to get out that secondary exit, which wasn't possible because cars and trucks had clogged that small section of Huron Church just west of the bridge almost instantly. There was a decision made at one point by myself to allow trucks access to College westbound, which I didn't want to do because that was out emergency route for fire, because they - - their fire station is just east of Huron Church. And if protesters clog College, we were in a bad way. But there was no -- there was just no other decision to make at that point. We literally had to do what we could to clear that bridge. So, and again with negotiations through all that to allow us to essentially, you know, open this part, open that part, to eventually clear the bridge, and I think the bridge was cleared of traffic by about 10:20 at night.

They started their action. So I would say just -- and then they were -- I wouldn’t say that there were 700 officers at one point.

18-237-28,"Okay. So a perfect example of informal request was this Emergency Preparedness Committee that I sit on for the OACP. Again, we are meeting at least two, three times a week by -- just by -- on Zoom or Teams or whatever it was. And the discussion, at this time, before our blockade, was focussing on Ottawa and the Toronto weekend protests that were happening every weekend. So amongst police leaders at our ranks and superintendent, inspector, those were the requests saying, okay, who can send people to Ottawa? It necessarily wasn't POU specific, but it was who can spare some bodies for Ottawa, or who can send people to Toronto. So after our blockade was concluded, months went by. Ottawa had two other pretty robust protests, Rolling Thunder and there was another one, I don't remember the name of it, but we sent people from Windsor, because they needed people on ground. We don't have Public Order, but we sent resources because, you know, that was the right thing to do, and we felt that we really had a debt to actually pay for a lot of the other services. So that's just an example of an informal request. They would eventually be formalized through the Chiefs, which again, is covered in the Police Act. Chief makes a request to the Commissioner and that's one, you know, one of the ways that those -- or those formal requests are made. I can't see that a Superintendent is going to authorize these requests without the Chief knowing so.",18-237-30,237,30,28,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

So there's a Canadian Tire, for instance, right, on that northwest -- northeast corner. If they're on that sidewalk outside of our jersey barriers, we had no problem with that. If they're inside the area of control that we were trying to establish, they were asked to leave, and if they weren’t, they were arrested. So that arrest in that video that we were shown, that is in that area of control on Huron Church north of Tecumseh Road between the Tecumseh Road and the bridge.

I had an additional almost over 400 officers come to the city. To be able to get that many members to the city, we had to do some logistical operations within our organization, and one of those was to cancel block training, which is annual training for members on use of force and firearm requalification.

And I received an email from that unit saying that the Solicitor-General wanted the number of OPP members that have been in Ottawa since the beginning of the event. So I asked my team to create a chart which indicated the numbers from the beginning of the event until the 2nd of February, and I described what that chart looked like yesterday. It include numbers of logistical people, EOC members, frontline members, Public Unit Order members. And I emailed that to my Chief Superintendent, and since we’re a paramilitary organization, we follow the chain of command.

You can only help when you have a true understanding for what the needs are and to understand those needs. And we left that meeting with a commitment from Ottawa Police that they would provide the plans to us. We asked for e-versions, whatever version they could get to us would be very helpful, so that we could see what they have on paper in terms of a plan and then what we would reasonably need to do to complement that plan.

07-135-19,"A broad or overarching kind of concept of operations for the truck demonstration. And we had discussions about that. We were given -- we were asking for numbers. We had -- there was a sergeant -- or S/Sgt. LeBlanc from the Ottawa Police Service who provided us the breakdown on numbers, what they needed to sustain operations. And the number, if I’m not mistaken, was 516 IFTEs, or police officers, to sustain operations at all the checkpoints that they needed. We had a lot of debate about that. Ultimately, you know, there’s some math issues that we came to terms with. But again, our goal was there to completely understand. We didn’t just go in blank and say, “What do you need? Here you go.” So we had discussions about that and then we had discussions about -- well, overview provided to us by Supt. Patterson of an operation at Rideau and Sussex that they were contemplating. It was -- my notes reflect that it was scheduled for 4:00, with a possibility of being moved up to 11:00 p.m. that night. As I noted, I brought those that I did to this meeting for a specific purpose. And, you know, we had discussed prior to, “We’re going there as a team. If you have input to give, give it. You know, we have a lot to get done here in a short period of time. Let’s not hold anything back here.” So Darwin Tetreault asked if he could speak when he was being presented this thing, and I do appreciate when I heard the tail end of Supt. Abrams’ evidence that he mentioned a number of 400. The number in my mind, in my notes, was 800. He said based on his knowledge of POU, when you look at the dynamics of this event, the number of areas that were blockaded, and the work that had to be done, we would need approximately 800 POU officers to effectively dismantle this protest. But furthermore, and the key thing for me, hearing from a subject matter expert with his level of experience, is that once you start this operation, you should not stop. And their intention, as it was presented to us, was kind of do it -- to use the words that were used, “chunk by chunk”. And there was recognition that it would be very resource intensive, that it would take a significant demand on resources to do it that way.",07-135-21,135,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

There was a lot of discussion around resources, because when raised that number, and again, the number sticks out to me because it ultimately was the number of POU, approximately, that we needed to successfully dismantle. So Darwin Tetreault is from the National Capital Region, he lives in this area, he runs these programs nationally for public order maintenance, he is a Public Order person himself, and he had given a lot of thought to in understanding the zones which had been presented the day before in terms of all the checkpoints and key areas of concern in the red zone. So, you know, I thought, you know, very clearly he’s already put some significant insight in terms of what needs to be done to successfully shut this down. So Chief Sloly very passionately, and very concerned about the reliability of getting resources. He was very concerned that we would come through. He wanted guarantees, with no caveats, that “If you’re going to say you’re going to give us X, you’re going to give us x. Period. No questions asked.” We just stressed that we’re building a plan, we have the support of our organizations to get what is needed to develop a plan to successfully shut this down.",07-137-21,137,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

07-140-17,"So let me ask you this. As I understand it then, you were offering to help and then you said you needed a plan. But putting this in context, because this happened on February the 9th; right? So we’re already more than a week into the protests, and the Commission has heard evidence how that has caused significant social impact on the residents and so on. And if the suggestion is that you need a plan before we can send resources, isn’t that problematic? Because they may not, at that stage, have even the resources to do the planning? So how do they get more resources?",07-140-19,140,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,MR. FRANK AU,frank au
07-140-27,"Well that’s a very loaded question. Essentially you need a plan to be able to communicate with police leaders. When you’re asking for resources from around the province, and in this case, around the country, you need to be able to articulate what that need is and why that need exists. And in doing that, it’s always about, you know, what are my officers going to be doing when they get there? How -- what are the logistics? What are the plans, the briefings? Everything is something that you always provide. We’re in a state right now that, you know, I learned really quickly that staffing was an issue for OPS. Staffing is an issue with just about every policing organization out there for a myriad of reasons. So as a regional commander coming into this from another region where you’re going to be called upon to provide resources to supplement an operational plan, you’ll pulling from resources that you have available to police your communities. And oftentimes, in a lot of my detachments, we’re already at our base level. So when you’re still, because of a crisis, you’re going to pull -- you’re going to pull them only when they’re needed, not to sit around waiting to know what they’re going to do when they get there. Plan is absolutely critical. And it can be a concept, because we developed a concept of operations within 48 hours of being in Ottawa.

It goes back to our mission in ensuring that safety is built into your mission, and that was a key component for us. We wanted to reduce the component -- the footprint of the protest zone to the utmost extent possible. You talk to planners in major events like this, they’ll say, “We’re not going to arrest our way out of this. We’re not going to -- it’s going to be impossible”. So you have to look to compliance and appeal to the better senses of people that are involved to get them to want to voluntarily exit the zone. And that was a key component of our plan because we knew that from a capacity perspective if we had to start putting bracelets on everybody there, we’d need 10,000 officers to do that.

We need access to this. Can we make this up? So I was the guy trying to work our way around any barriers that we were facing. And I know that the lead planners who I had tremendous trust and confidence in just said, ""We need him, and he's being pulled away again. We need him back here ASAP.

You’ve answered a lot of questions about, you know, the details of what happened in Ottawa. Part of the mandate of this Commission and part of what I think the Commissioner may be interested in hearing about as well is taking a look at the bigger picture. Lessons learned is part of the mandate of this Commission and you’re in a unique position, as a recent retiree, with 36 years of experience doing this kind of public order policing and incident command, to maybe give some thoughts that may be of assistance to the Commissioner.

You know, when you stand -- when you deploy five, 600 officers to another organization, they come with a command and control. If you don’t integrate, you’re going to be working in silos. If you don’t integrate, you’re not going to be communicating about the ultimate strategic objectives and goals of what you’re trying to accomplish.

So in my humble opinion, I would use PLT in every circumstance. They may last 10 minutes and be rendered ineffective, but we tried. We’ve given -- we’ve tried a negotiation route. We’ve tried the de-escalation route. It did not work. Before we go kinetic.",07-276-22,276,22,21,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. CHRISTOPHER DIANA,C/SUPT. CARSON PARDY,c/supt. carson pardy

07-277-19,"There’s a significant role. In fact, when you look -- I’m sure you’ll get this from Insp. Beaudin. A lot of what PLT does, because it’s not just with the protestors that they deal with. A lot of what they do is education as well. You know, they -- our PLTs are active not just in the middle of a crisis. They’re active all -- so education is absolutely critical. The public needs to know. When we engage PLT in these events, we have PLT members who are dealing with the Business Association. We have PLT members dealing with the residents so that we know, collectively, all of the issues that we’re facing. So they’re not just negotiating with the protestors necessarily. They’re looking at everybody that is impacted by. Education. I would love for every member of the public to become a PLT. One of our goals in our communication strategy was to make every uniformed officer, with their messaging, from the constable on the street up to the Prime Minister of Canada, if we could get everybody saying the same message, we’re educating the public, we will succeed. That was the stated goal right within our mission.",07-277-20,277,20,19,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. CHRISTOPHER DIANA,C/SUPT. CARSON PARDY,c/supt. carson pardy

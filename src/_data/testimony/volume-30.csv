The first is probably fairly well understood. The Deputy Prime Minister aspect maybe less so.",30-009-18,9,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-009-24,"Okay. So as Minister of Finance, I'm responsible for Canada's federal finances. I think that role does also include a broader responsibility for the economy as a whole. One of the principal jobs which is relevant to our discussion today, one of the principal jobs obviously of the Department of Finance is preparing a budget every year. That budget is presented in the spring. My second role is as Deputy Prime Minister. That is a more loosely defined role. I would say it means I'm available to do whatever the Prime Minister needs me to do. I maybe am especially involved in areas where I have a particular background or knowledge or expertise. Today and during the period that this covers, that would certainly involve Ukraine and Russia. And I think it does often involve my past as a Trade Minister and my involvement in the negotiation of the new NAFTA. And then maybe the final thing worth mentioning is, you know, largely, you know, being the Finance Minister is a big and consuming role, particularly when a budget is being prepared. Being Deputy Prime Minister as well, I feel a particular responsibility when an issue emerges as being of sort of overwhelming national significance, even if it's not specifically in my lane, to start getting involved.",30-009-26,9,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-010-23,"Well, that leads fairly nicely into my next question actually because that dual role you had as Minister of Finance and as Deputy Prime Minister puts you in a unique position to tell us a little bit about the context in which the events that are before the Commission, the Freedom Convoy and the protests, occurred. So we spoke about this a bit in your interview and I'm hoping you can put -- situate in context from your unique perspective what was going on.",30-010-25,10,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-011-03,"Okay. Well, I'll try. And I'll mostly focus on the economic and financial perspective because that was largely my focus. So all of this started to happen at the end of January. And it's worth bearing in mind, as I said, we were preparing the budget at that point. We were sort of deep, deep in budget preparation mode. And that means that the Department of Finance, I personally, Michael Sabia, we were all really focussed on where is the Canadian economy right now, and what is our path forward. And I think it's worth reminding people that it was a really challenging time for the Canadian economy. COVID was still very much with us in January. In Ontario, there had been lockdowns. There was virtual school. So we still have COVID with us. We could see beyond it, and we could see that the time was coming to go from a COVID lockdown, really emergency government support for the economy situation to reopening the economy and doing everything we could to achieve a soft landing for the Canadian economy after the trauma of COVID, the COVID lockdowns, the COVID recession, the economic trauma. That meant that we were particularly focussed in the economy on two things. One was supply chains. You know, by now, I think it's sort of become part of the common discourse that supply chains were strained by COVID. It was maybe less apparent to regular Canadians in January of this year, but it was really apparent to us that the peculiar nature of the global economy during COVID had placed some very significant strains on supply chains. That was jeopardizing Canada's recovery from the COVID recession in areas like the lack of semiconductors putting real stress on our car sector, to give just one example of very specific supply chain problems that we were focussed on and thinking about. The second area we were really focussed on, which again has moved more into what everyday people are talking about, but we were focussed on it already in January was we could see, partly because of those strained supply chains, that inflation was elevated and rising. And so it was apparent, I think to us, that we were going to be moving from the covid recession situation, where the challenge was, you know, prevent the greatest downturn since the Great Depression in Canada from really taking hold and scarring the Canadian economy. That had been the preoccupation during covid. We knew that we were moving into an environment where the challenge was reopening and elevated inflation, and how do you deal with that. And that made us particularly concerned, again, about the supply chains, because they posed a challenge to elevated inflation. So I would say that was kind of my Finance Minister budget related set of concerns. The second economic issue that I was very focused on in December/January -- November/December/January, was the U.S. Build Back Better legislation. And in particular, their proposal on EV incentives. And, you know, I realize to an Ottawa kind of maybe legal community type audience, that might seem a little bit esoteric. But the reality is -- and it might seem a little bit esoteric and a little bit specific. The EV incentives, as proposed by the U.S. -- and that legislation made its way through the House in the fall in the U.S., I believe in November. That legislation, as proposed, would have been completely devastating to the future of the Canadian car sector. What the incentives would have done, had they been passed into law as initially proposed is create very strong incentives for buying electric vehicles that were made in the U.S., not North America, just the U.S. And EVs, that’s a nation industry; right? We’re just shifting to the production of EVs. Imagine if you are a car company -- and all the car companies that produce cars in Canada operate on both sides of the border. Imagine these powerful U.S. incentives are put in place, but they only apply to EVs and batteries made in the U.S. Are you going to build anything in Canada? Are you going to put any of those production lines in Canada? And the answer is you wouldn’t have. And, you know, these incentives, frankly, were quite intentionally designed to drive all of the building of the new fledgling EV industry into the U.S. only and to create a powerful economic disincentive to build any of that in Canada. That would have been a disaster for us because EVs are the cars of the future. And to just give you a final kind of sense of how significant this was, at the end of 2021, Marry Ng, the Trade Minister, and I, sent a letter, which we made public, to the U.S. warning that Canada was prepared to retaliate, at scale, were this measure to be passed into law. In December, in Finance, we were looking at and putting the final touches on a retaliation list, because whenever there is trade retaliation, the first step is you publish the list of things you might retaliate against. We did that during the 232 challenge, say we say, the 232 Tariff challenge. The initial retaliation list that we were looking at was going to include up to $100 billion of U.S. imports into Canada. So that’s to give you a sense of the scale that we judged this challenge to be at. Now, we didn’t want to do that. We really didn’t want a trade war. That would have been terrible for Canada. And so we were also negotiating. And we were talking all of us, the Prime Minister with President Biden, Mary Ng with the U.S. TR. I was speaking about it with Janet Yellen at the Treasury. And really, the key person emerged as a guy called Brian Deese, who is in the White House. He is the President’s Economic Advisor. And what we were trying to persuade Brian Deese of is the idea that look, we understand that you want incentives for electric vehicles. We believe in that too. We also believe in the green transition. We understand that you want U.S. workers to benefit from these incentives, but our car sector is very, very closely interconnected. A favourite line that you’ll hear every single Canadian trade negotiator who ever has negotiated mention to the Americans on this is a single car part can cross the border six times on the way to becoming part of a car. So we say that all the time to the Americans. And so what I said to Brian is, our sectors are totally integrated. We’re not asking for a free ride from the U.S. Why don’t we match your incentives, and you guys have incentives, we’ll have incentives too, and both of us have incentives for North American made EVs, thus creating a level playing field between Canada and the U.S. and frankly, a strong incentive for investment into Canada, because in that kind of an environment, Canadian made EVs would be uniquely able to be sold into the U.S. market. So that was what we were talking about precisely at that time. And in the months of December and January, we were drafting these ideas. My department was working on it, and I was sharing them with the Treasury and with Brian Deese. And actually, at the very end of January, my department prepared for me a sort of yet another iteration of this sort of Deese note on how can we coordinate? So that was sort of a second direction of economic concern. I would even say anxiety. We knew we had to make this work, coming at exactly that time. And then the final thing, which was more maybe a Deputy Prime Minister area of focus, was Russia and Ukraine. The war hadn’t started yet, but we and our allies started to get intelligence in December and in January that Russia could well be preparing to invade Ukraine. I was briefed directly at the beginning of January that the judgement was this could really happen. And again, it’s happened now, so we might not fully remember how astonishing and horrifying that thought was before it actually happened. It’s horrifying now too, of course. So, you know, that was a very big deal. I learned about it at the beginning of January and the threat just kept getting greater, and greater, and greater. I believe NATO troops were put on alert at the end of January and then I think the U.S. took this extraordinary step of declassifying its intelligence about Russia’s plans in early February, to kind of alert everyone. And I was also involved at the Finance Minister level, working with other Finance Ministers, talking to the Ukrainians about putting together sort of pre-emptive sanctions. If you think back to that time, the idea was we would be very explicit with Russia about the sanctions that would snap in in the event of an invasion. So we were working on that. So that was kind of a third area I was very aware of. I thought then, and I think today, that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which of course did ultimately happen, is the biggest challenge to Canada’s national security since the Second World War. I think it’s a very serious attack on western democracies, on the rules-based international order. I took it seriously then and I believed it was really important for Canada to be in a strong position to be able to respond.",30-011-05,11,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-017-02,"Fair enough. In the interest of time, I’m just going to go over a couple of points and then move on. But so the last point you raised was what was going on in Ukraine, you saw a link to that, Canada’s national security. So that link may not be obvious; it’s something going on in the other end of the world. So what do you mean by that, that would be a risk to Canada’s national security?",30-017-04,17,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-017-10,"well, Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is the first time that one internationally recognized state has tried to take -- has tried to conquer or seize the territory of another since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. It’s a very grave violation of what I think is one of the greatest accomplishments of the post-World War II international order, which was, you know, a basic, basic understanding that internationally recognized countries don’t invade each other and seize each other’s territory. Now, that has been perfectly honoured, but if you compare the entire post-World War II period with all of human history prior to that, it’s a huge change, and that has hugely enhanced the security of every country in the world. So that’s number one. Number two way that Canada’s security was threatened, is threatened, but I think our -- I think the Allied response has been strong and has strengthened Canada, is I absolutely believe that one of Vladimir Putin’s warnings -- you know, his principal objective was -- is -- to crush Ukraine to take it over; to crush Ukrainians as a people and to replace democratically elected government, to make it a puppet satrapy. But he has another objective, which is to show that dictatorships work, and democracies don’t. There is a broader goal he has in mind, and that is, I believe, in his view, because he wants that demonstration effect; he wants to show Russians, “You know, you might not like that much, how things work here, but we’re better than those, you know, weak, feeble, pathetic Western democracies.” That’s sort of the message that he wants to communicate with what he perceives to be his own strength. And his success, were he to be successful, I absolutely believe would weaken Western democracies writ large, including our own.",30-017-12,17,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

You said that that dovetailed, basically, with negotiations on the electric vehicle incentives. And in the chronology -- you can appreciate this is the second-last day of the Commission’s testimony, so we’ve been a lot of chronology of what happened in those early days, and I want to focus with you this morning on your specific involvement.

So that was just out there as a threat that I had in mind. So up until February 6th, 90 percent budget; EVs on one side; worried about Russia/Ukraine; hoping that we can put forward strong sanction ideas that will prevent it, but it was really budget, budget, budget. But then the second weekend of the occupation happened, and I started hearing, particularly from business leaders, that this was starting to be an area of concern.

30-021-13,"So from a finance/economic perspective, that escalated things exponentially; that’s what made it a hugely significant economic action. And, you know, I had started to get really worried on the Sunday. I attended the Cabinet Committee meeting; the bridge is occupied on the Monday. I start talking very urgently with my team, with Michael Sabia and officials, and we basically go through sort of three thought processes. Number one, is this a really huge problem that has risen to the level of that we need to figure out a way to stop this? And by the beginning of that week, especially with the bridge blockade, we were coming to that conclusion; we have to figure out something to do. So then step two is; we’re the Department of Finance. I think you’ve probably heard from other ministers, the instruction was, “Okay, everyone, take a look in your toolbox and figure out what tools are available to you to act on this.” And so that’s what we did. And we found, looking at what was in the finance toolbox, that there were basically two areas where there could be authority. One was FINTRAC, which is the centre that sort of monitors financial transactions, money laundering, terrorist financial activity, and then the second was the Bank Act, and would there be authorities under the Bank Act that could be useful in resolving this situation. So that was the two areas we looked at. We looked at what the existing tools, available as of that moment, permitted us to do, and we came to the conclusion pretty quickly that everything that could be utilized was being utilized. So then we thought, well, is there a need to legislate, and that memo outlines areas where the department said you could legislate to create this authority, or, you know, you could legislate to create these various authorities as outlined in the memo.",30-021-15,21,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-022-21,"We definitely looked at them. As you know, I would say -- let me say a couple of things. So on the FINTRAC front, what we concluded was, you know, to put it in maybe kind of more regular terms, what we concluded, and this is something that finance officials had been thinking about for a while, is that basically the FINTRAC monitoring authorities were appropriate for a 20th century economy, but not for a 21st century economy. That FINTRAC -- so FINTRAC, and I know you guys know this because you have been over this for hours and hours and hours, but maybe for people who are tuning in for the first time, FINTRAC is not an enforcement agency. The job of FINTRAC is to monitor what's going on, to both look into reports that it gets and to just kind of have situational awareness and let us know what's happening in terms of illicit financial flows in Canada. I think that's a summary I would offer you of FINTRAC, of FINTRAC's job. What we were sort of reminded of in looking at this is FINTRAC's sort of line of sight was very blinkered. They could look into what you might call the 20th century financial system, but they didn't have authority over the 21st century financial system. And by that specifically, I mean over crowdfunding and over payment platforms. So that was the lacuna. It was well known that it was a lacuna, but there hadn't been an urgency to act. And the memo identifies this is an authority that we think FINTRAC should have, and you could legislate to create that authority. Subsequently, as we all became FINTRAC experts very quickly, or thought we were becoming FINTRAC experts very quickly, we understood that regulatory authority would be sufficient to grant FINTRAC these additional powers. And as you know, that's what we ultimately did. So FINTRAC, one area. And then second area which is outlined in this note is could the Bank Act be used to allow the banks to effectively freeze accounts. That's basically what the memo discusses, and it discusses what would be the different authorities which would allow that. And so those were the options that were developed there. Maybe the final point worth mentioning with regard to that memo is in terms of a legislative path, what we understood was it takes a long time. And, look, it's a good thing that it takes a long time for legislation to be passed in Canada, even when we're working really together and urgently and quickly. And an example, you know, just this fall of Parliament coming together, understanding an urgent necessity and passing legislation was the Bill that granted us the authority to double the GST credit, which we proposed as soon as we returned from the summer recess. It gained all party's support, and it speeded through. And, you know, we got -- we proposed it in the middle of September, and we got the first cheques out to Canadians on November 5th. In Parliamentary legislative time, that is a sprint, and that was good, because we know that Canadians need inflation relief, but that's really, really fast from September 19th to November 5th. So -- and that's just one real-life example where there was urgent action by Parliament and the Senate -- and the House and the Senate. And so while this -- we looked at what the legislative options could be, we quickly understood that they would take a long time.",30-022-23,22,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And we were -- maybe just as a quick footnote, I don't want to offend the Treasury, in talking about these EV incentives, we were very much in touch with the Treasury, both with Secretary Yellen and with David Lipton, who worked in the Treasury.

30-026-06,"I try to. What was striking to me about the conversation I had with him on the 10th of February is he is a person who is very hard for Canadians to get a hold of. And actually, in the fall when we realized how significant the EV issue was, and when in my conversations with the Treasury I really learned how important the White House and Brian Deese were, and also our Ambassador Kirsten Hillman sort of identified to us Brian Deese is the guy you have to talk to. And it was a real effort to develop a relationship and a dialogue with him, and an effort to get -- always an effort to get him on the phone, to get him to answer an email. And I don't mean that in any way to slight him. He's an extremely busy person. In a way, the fact that it's hard for Canada to reach him is a good thing. It means we're a peace border and good government country and they're not very worried about us. And so what was really striking to me was how quickly he got on the phone with me on that Thursday. It was instant. And while in some ways, you know, that was in -- as a practical matter that was good, but it gave me a measure of how worried the White House was about this.",30-026-08,26,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-027-03,"Okay. So starting February 10th, so this is you, Minister Freeland, writing. You say, ""He called me. They are very, very, very worried. If this is not sorted out in the next 12 hours, all of their north eastern car plants will shut down. He said that he supposed that this proved the point [that] we had made previously to them about how closely integrated our economies are. (He did not seem to see this as a positive.) He asked what he could do to help us. I said - - Tow trucks - Make your point about banning travel to the US for participants public - Arrange a call between the PM and the President"" And then you say: “He was aware of points 1 and 2 [tow trucks and banning travel] and said he would push on both. He was supportive of the idea of a call and would try to make it happen.” So can you flesh out that summary a little bit, of what Mr. Deese was conveying to you?",30-027-05,27,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-028-03,"Yeah. I mean, you know, I think -- can you move up a little bit? Just, you know, I think the point, the second sentence, he said that this proved the point about how integrated our economies are and he didn’t seem to see this as a positive, he brought that up. And you have to kind of bear in mind, I have been bugging the guy, and Canadians have been nagging Americans since the fall, and we’ve been saying, “Guys, you don’t understand Canada. You don’t understand how integrated our economies are. This approach you’re taking to the EVs, it’s completely counterproductive for you, because we work so closely together, those parts, they cross the border six times.” We’ve been saying this over and over. And so he comes back at me and he says, “Yeah, okay.” Like, “You’ve made the point. We get it.” And it was a surprise to him, actually, the extent to which their car industry was dependent on the trade with Canada. But that was a dangerous moment for Canada, I felt. Very, very dangerous. Because the U.S. then and now, as part of their own soft landing from covid, something that is happening there is a real move to protect the supply chains of the United States, the same supply chain challenges I was talking about earlier is affecting Canada, affected the U.S. And I think we have all seen a very strong push this year, by Americans, to insulate their supply chains, particularly, from China, are very worried about the semiconductors, but more broadly, covid brought alive to them the vulnerability of their supply chains. And this was so worrying to me because I could see, really, for the first time ever, the Americans having this amber light flashing in Canada. And this amber light that said to them, “You know what? The Canadian supply chain could be a vulnerability too.” And that’s a problem for us because there are plenty of Americans, both Democrats and republicans, who would love any excuse to impose more protectionist measures on us. So that line to me, it jumped out at me, it made me really, really worried, and I understood -- I really understood at that point that the danger wasn’t just the danger of the -- it wasn’t just the immediate damage. It wasn’t just the immediate harm. It wasn’t, oh, you know, this plant looses four days of operation. The danger was were we in the process as a country of doing long-term and possibly irreparable harm to our trading relationship with the United States. And it’s also important to understand that our trading relationship with the United States, it’s not just about Canada/U.S. trade. It’s about Canada’s attractiveness as a destination for all foreign investments. Japanese car companies invest in Canada because of our trading relationship with the United States. So that one conversation was a seminal one for me, and it was a moment when I realized, as a country, somehow we had to find a way to bring this to an end.",30-028-05,28,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And so Flavio and his constituent companies and the trade negotiators and I worked really closely together on the specifics of the deal. And Flavio also, you know, significantly, I think, for this exchange, Flavio was very aware of the EV issue. And if I have seemed to you guys today to be kind of weirdly obsessed with EVs, and U.S. EV incentives, I would urge you to spend five minutes talking to Flavio and you will understand how really kind of life or death for the car sector it is.

So this is at the point, I guess, where the Emergencies Act has been involved. And you say -- express to him: “I know devastating this has been and am determined that we need to take strong action.

So I don’t want to pretend to knowledge of that. But, you know, I can give you some context for that view that I expressed there, which I do remember expressing, which I think is consistent with what I’ve been saying earlier this morning, that all of us who had been involved in the NAFTA negotiation, very much the car sector people, but I think you'll see that I also had a text exchange with one of the steel guys, you know, all of the industries that were very implicated in the NAFTA negotiations were aware of how Canada's access to the U.S. market was both essential and kind of constantly fragile and in need of tending. I don't know, maybe it's like a marriage. Like your whole life is based on it, but you have to take care of it every single day. And these people, whose jobs, whose livelihoods depending on it really understood that. And like I'm aware as I'm speaking that this might seem esoteric to lawyers, and what I really want to say is, you know, especially for me, personally, the NAFTA negotiations were kind of a bonding experience, just for me as an elected Canadian leader, with everyone who works in a Canadian car plant or a Canadian car part plant with Canadian steelworkers, with Canadian aluminum workers, with people in Regina who make pipes. I knew during the NAFTA negotiations their jobs were on the line, and they knew it too. And all of those people across Canada, they were so great. Like they were prepared for Canada to take a strong position, they were prepared for the U.S. President to insult us, they were prepared for us to take really strong retaliatory actions against the 232 tariffs because they knew how important it was for them and their jobs and their lives. And what text exchange with Flavio represents is me sharing with him something I know he felt too, which is this really important market access that we managed to secure just a couple of years ago, it's constantly under threat, witness the EV incentives, and it's under threat right now, and we just -- we can't let Canada be devastated this way.",30-033-12,33,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So he sends you this, and he says: ""Hi Chrystia, I hope [you're] well...I know you have your hands full...I'm not saying anything you [probably] don't know ..but this is really impacting us badly now like many others, and I fear, that even worse, the long term consequences of shutting down auto plants because of lack of Canadian parts, will only convince the auto companies 'on shore' even more and relocate supplies..."" This is a bit annoying because it's in three separate documents. So Mr. Clerk, can you take that one down, and put up SSM.CAN00004349. Record time. Okay, so that's a continuation of the text: ""...relocate supplies (and our customers) to the USA. I know it sucks politically to back down and reverse course, but does it really pay to carry on the policy in support of a mandate for a vaccine that doesn't prevent the spread of omicron and which seems to be vanishing naturally anyway?

I do, sort of as a matter of course, meet with the bank CEOs as a group every six months, and obviously, they can and should have access to me, like, they should be able to meet with me. But it usually takes a while for people's calendars to work and for the meeting to be arranged. And it's highly unusual for them to want to talk to me on a weekend. So that was significant to me that they wanted to talk to me on the phone. I spoke to both of them, I am sure, pretty sure -- well, 90 percent sure I spoke to both of them before this call at 1 p.m. on Sunday with all of the bank CEOs. And each of them expressed a high degree of concern about the damage being done to Canada and the Canadian economy, which was then reflected in the group call.",30-039-19,39,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-040-14,"Okay. So let's have a look at that group call now. Mr. Clerk, it's SSM.CAN.00008766. So this is about a three-page document, Minister Freeland, and I'm just going to take you to certain excerpts of it that I'd like you to elaborate on. So the first one, Mr. Clerk, if you just scroll -- there we go. We don't know who's speaking here, but whoever it is, it's one of the bank CEOs, says, ""The big hole in our financial system is these platforms, which are effectively money service businesses that are not being regulated as such."" So that -- these platforms refers to the payment processors, the crowdfunding platforms?",30-040-16,40,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-040-28,"I believe so. I mean, I shouldn't put words in the mouth of another person, but I think one of the messages that I recall came through in this call and that, you know, my memory was refreshed when I looked at these notes, one of the messages from the bank CEOs was kind of what finance had concluded independently earlier in the week, which is there's this whole space where financial transactions happen that no one has any line of sight to. And that is crowdfunding platforms, or the crowdfunding platforms, the payment systems, and then I think someone also mentions crypto later on in this call.",30-040-30,40,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,DEPUTY PM CHRYSTIA FREELAND,deputy pm chrystia freeland
30-041-11,"Yeah, I think they do. That's right. So we'll just scroll down a little bit there. I'm not sure we're going to get to crypto just yet, but we are going to get to your response here where you say, ""I am very prepared to come out and speak about this. This is an attack on democracy. We need to educate Canadians about this."" What do you mean by this is an attack on democracy here?",30-041-13,41,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS.

30-041-21,"So I was responding specifically to one of the CEOs whose bank had acted to freeze an account based on -- this was prior to the invocation of the Emergencies Act. It was based, as that note shows, on what the banks anti-money laundering systems detected, and based on that, the bank rightly acted. What was a concern for me, and this was -- this did shape how we acted, was the banks being blamed for taking this action, the banks being seen as choosing to do it, as having the agency. And it was particularly a concern, and you note the mention of Fox News -- the thing you have to remember about Canadian banks is many of them are significant banks in the United States as well. They are big players there, and some of them trade under their Canadian names. And so they were in jeopardy not only in Canada, but also in the United States, if they were being seen to taking a politicized position. I didn't think that was their responsibility. I thought it was the responsibility of the government to make judgments about this.",30-041-23,41,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-042-11,"Okay. The next concern highlighted there is, ""Canada's reputation indeed is at risk. We need to show the world proactively that we won't let this happen again [...] our trade corridors will remain open. We should think about putting the military in place to keep the border crossings moving even after the protestors are removed. To send a clear signal."" So this is about as strong a suggestion as you can get, bring in the military. And your response though here is, ""Couldn't agree more with those points. We must make clear that 1) we will resolve this [and] 2) we won't let this happen again."" So can you explain your response there? Were you agreeing there that bringing in the military to patrol the borders was a viable option?",30-042-13,42,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-043-04,"No. It was -- I mean, look, if you look at that conversation, people raised lots of different points in their commentary, and I didn't respond to every single one, just as in my previous exchange with Alan Kestenbaum, our Stelco guy, I acknowledged his concern, but I didn't really address his public health measure point. My point there was, as I said in my follow-up, that what we need to is, as a government, one, resolve it, two, be clear it's not going to happen again. And, you know, from my perspective, I wanted - - the reason I convened that call, and again, probably worth highlighting, it is highly unusual for the CEOs, like, highly, highly, like, never -- I mean, I've only been Finance Minister for two years, but it hasn't happened before and I hope it will never happen again -- for the CEOs of all of Canada's banks on, you know, a couple of hours' notice on a Sunday afternoon to come together on a Zoom call with the Finance Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance. It's very, very unusual for them to find the time to do that. I'm right now trying to organize a meeting with them, my kind of every six-month meeting, for December, and it's the kind of thing that we sort of organize four to six weeks in advance because these are all busy people. So that's kind of just worth mentioning. It shows their degree of concern and anxiety. Value for me of this meeting, why did I want to have it, what did I want to get out of it? Two things. One, I wanted to hear from them how worried were they. By that point, I was really worried, but we were contemplating, as you know, really serious action. And I needed to hear directly myself from the leaders of Canada's financial institutions did they share my level of concern. That was a very important proof point for me. So that was kind of number one. And it was important for me for them -- it was important for it to be a meeting of everyone because that's also a measure of how worried were they; right? Are you prepared to say these things to a group of your peers? Is that -- that's -- you judge your words carefully there and you should. So, number one, am I right to be as worried as I am? What do these guys think? And then number two concern was, okay, we do have some tools. Are -- how are the tools working? The people who have these tools, who are in charge of using them, how are they finding they work in practice? Those were the two things I tried to get out of the call. And it was a very useful call in terms of answering both those questions.",30-043-06,43,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-044-21,"So maybe the next extract I wanted to point out goes to that second point. Mr. Clerk, can you just scroll down a little -- there we go. So this is someone saying, ""We need court orders to act. We had identified an individual who is an organizer who had several hundred thousand dollars move into their accounts, we flagged it to FINTRAC...started work on a court order and because of the delay of 4 hours, the money was withdrawn before we cold stop it.” And you say there, you ask: “Was the problem there...a gap in the current system or [that] it moves too slowly?” And the reply is, “4 hours was too long.” And then I think underneath that, there’s, “And let’s be clear...”; that’s the reference you were talking about: “And let’s be clear, they will all eventually move to crypto.” Okay. A little lower down -- Mr. Clerk, bottom of that page -- you mention reputational risk. That’s something you’ve talked about several times. Here’s one of those, I think, quotable quotes: “Agree with my colleagues. The reputation of Canada is at risk. Just spent a lot of time in the US last week and we were being called a ‘Joke’ by people. I had one investor say ‘I won’t invest another red cent in your banana republic in Canada.’ That adds to an already tough investment perspective on Canada.” Did that have any impact, the banana republic idea? I mean, it’s hyperbolic.",30-044-23,44,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-046-03,"Well, I mean, I believe, and subsequent conversations underscore -- you know, if I were an editor, I would ask my -- still an editor, I would ask my reporter, “Is that a direct quote, or are you paraphrasing?” And I think subsequent conversations we had show that was a direct quote, and a direct quote that a Canadian bank CEO was relaying to me that he had heard on an investment trip to the US from someone who he wanted to invest in Canada; he was trying to persuade someone to invest in Canada. And that was a heart-stopping quote, for me. That was really a moment when having already been concerned, when I really understood that what was happening was profoundly jeopardizing the Canadian economy and putting investment in Canada at risk. And, you know, I don’t expect you guys to have read our April budget, but one of the things we identify in the April budget is underinvestment as being a core problem for the Canadian economy, an Achilles heel. We don’t have a high enough rate of business investment. We’ve done really well. Like, I don’t want to talk Canada down. Canada’s fantastic. Our economy is very strong; we have a great jobs recovery from the COVID recession. But one indicator where we’re underperforming is business investment. And, again, that can sound like a dry thing to focus on, but a lack of business investment ultimately translates into Canadians not having jobs and Canadians not having jobs that pay well enough to maintain a good standard of living. That’s what a lack of business investment means. And that quote relayed to me, really made me realize I had a duty of stewardship; I have a duty. I had, at that moment, a very profound duty to Canadians to stand up for them. And I’m surprised that I’m getting emotional, but I really felt it, and I felt like you know, the Canadian economy, it can feel like this amorphous thing; investment, it can seem amorphous; EV incentives, amorphous. But when I heard that, I realized, I’m the Finance Minister, I’m the Deputy Prime Minister, I have to protect Canadians; I have to protect their wellbeing, it’s being really, really damaged. So, yeah, that was a meaningful conversation for me and that was a very memorable quote, and for sure a spur to action.",30-046-05,46,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

But it is my job to -- ultimately, what’s the job of the Finance Minister? To make sure Canadians have a good life, right? And part of how Canadians have a good life is capital is invested into the Canadian economy, so they have well-paying jobs. And what that quote said is something is happening in Canada that very profoundly hurts Canadian jobs.

30-052-02,"I cannot recall whether I did or not, but my -- yeah. So I can’t remember. But, you know, it was a very busy time. A lot of people were speaking. My objective was, in a succinct way, to convey to my colleagues, who aren’t responsible for the economy, that this was a really serious economic impact. So I think that it was possible, you know, say you’re a Cabinet Minister, you don’t have principally economic responsibilities, you might be seeing this mostly about, you know, damage to Ottawa shopkeepers. And that’s really serious. I don’t want to understate the human toll of that. but what I wanted to communicate was this is getting to have a macro impact that will be material on the Canadian economy. And the only other thing that I would say is, you know, with hindsight, if anything, I feel that number -- I feel that that statement, if that’s all I said there, I feel that statement understated the possible impact, because the real challenge was it was exponential. So as it happened, that trade blockade was effectively a weeklong thing, and that’s what statistics ended up recording. But had it gone on, then you would have seen not an arithmetic adding up the damage of week, plus week, plus week. I think what you would have seen, and why this really rose to the level of a profound threat to Canada’s economy, was the exponential nature of it, that the longer it went on, the greater threat that the U.S. would lose faith in us and our trading relationship would be irreparably damaged.

The next topic I want to address with you is another concern that was being expressed around this time, which is the issue of foreign funding and foreign influence, and money flowing, largely, I think, up from the U.S., to fund the convoy. So Mr. Clerk, can you pull up, please, SSM.CAN.00001846? So this is an after the fact, not quite after the fact, but certainly after the invocation of the Emergencies Act, discussion that you’re having with your departmental officials. And if we scroll down a little bit, please, Mr. Clerk. Keep going. Keep going. I’ll let you know when to stop. Keep going. There we go. So this is a question that you’ve posed to your officials, and the question is: “And do we have any info on foreign donations?” And the response that comes back is: “We do not have any information on foreign donations that entered our Canadian financial systems. It is possible that FINTRAC, CSIS, or the RCMP possess information on foreign donations but that information is not shared with the Department of Finance.” So is it fair to say that at the points at which foreign influence, foreign donations were being talked about, the government wasn’t actually in possession of information to corroborate that?",30-053-11,53,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-054-12,"No, I wouldn’t say that. What I would say is a couple of things. One, one of the things that this occupation and the blockades really brought to our attention was how little official insight we had to crowdfunding and payment platforms, how little we knew for sure about what was going on there. And we’ve talked about that and we have since acted on a permanent basis to correct that. The -- there was very good reason to believe and in fact the subsequent report that the Commission did that I thought was very good on foreign donations documents in a lot of detail that there were foreign donations coming in to support the convoy. And so, you know, that was happening. Our own systems were weak at officially picking that up, and slow. And quite rightly, actually, there are a lot of checks and balances within the Canadian system about what Finance specifically learns; right? Because law enforcement and Finance are -- operate in different silos, and certainly elected Ministers and law enforcement have a lot of silos between them, and I think that’s a good thing.

30-055-08,"Yeah, I would 100 percent say that. And the other thing I would say is, you know, we were operating in the fog of war. And we -- things were moving very quickly in real life on the ground. We had to operate based on the best possible information we could get at every single moment. And sometimes that meant using open-source information. It didn’t always mean relying on official government information and analysis that came through the Finance channels. And I feel, you know, not only comfortable doing that, but that that’s the right thing to do. In a fast moving, hour by hour situation like this, you have to gather information from a lot of different sources, reliable sources. But I believe that’s the responsibility of an elected Minister. And if you don’t do that, my experience in government has been, you know, quite rightly, stuff that you officially get through official channels as a Minister, I don’t know, it’s like flour that has been sifted many, many times. It’s like very pure, very verified. It’s gone through a lot of different hands and there have been a lot of different checks on it. That’s a good thing, because it has, you know, Government of Canada stamp of approval. And I think it’s really good for us to have those systems. But at the same time, I think to do your job as a minister you have to be aware of and actively seek out other sources of information, including open sources of information, and I think you have to hear some things for yourself.

If we scroll down to page 8, Mr. Clerk. Bottom of the page, I believe. Okay, yeah. Sorry, here we go. So under Item Number 6 there, Roman numeral, this is a paragraph in the draft or a bullet point in the draft that says: ""...there is credible evidence that significant amounts of funding for the protests come from sources outside of Canada, which raises concerns about foreign interference in Canadian affairs and questions whether they represent threats to the security of Canada."" And the comment made on that underneath is: ""Anecdotal reports of donations from outside Canada to support the protesters were given credence, when, on February 13...hackers of the crowdfunding website, GiveSendGo...released hacked data..."" And it goes on to explain what happened there.

And we've talked about that at some length, but that's -- that -- I felt my job was in the Cabinet and as a teammate with my colleagues, you know, what were they relying on me as the Minister of Finance to do. They were relying on me to figure out and communicate to them how big is the economic problem, and then they were relying on me to figure out and communicate to them, ""Look, Finance guys, are you doing your job here? Are you awake? Are you using all the possible tools you have to stop the problem?"" That was my job number two. And then job number three is, ""Okay.

30-058-19,"Okay. We can take that one down, Mr. Clerk, and move on to... Well, it sort of goes back to what you were just addressing, Minister Freeland, what do we do about this, so the development and the implementation of the Emergency Economic Measures Order. So again, we've heard at this point quite a bit about the orders and about what was done with them, so I want to take you to a few specific concerns that have been expressed about them, the first one being that the EMO was overbroad in the sense that it might capture individuals who were not really directly involved in the protests, but people who donated to the protests and/or had adverse effects on family members. You know, if you freeze someone's bank account, it may be a spouse or a child of someone else who suffers. So my first question, was that -- is that a concern that you were aware of? Is that a concern that you had? And is that a concern that you felt was properly addressed with some of the -- with the measures that were enacted?",30-058-21,58,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-059-10,"Okay. That's a lot of questions, but it's -- I mean, that is kind of, I would say, core -- you're getting at some core things to be grappled with beforehand during the time the measures were enforce and in our reflections afterwards. And I want to start by saying something that I was really, really worried about and extremely conscious of the whole time was, you know, I've talked a lot about my profound conviction that Canada was in economic jeopardy, but then as we were talking about, okay, what can we do about it, I had probably an equally profound and even emotional concern of we don't want anybody to get hurt. And one of my colleagues said to me in our conversation about all of this, as, you know, we had -- we were talking constantly, and I was sort of saying we really have to act, something has to be done, and I remember a colleague saying to me ""my nightmare is blood on the face of a child."" And I remember that very clearly because I was worried about that. And I really was conscious that yes, we had to end this, but it was so important for it to be ended peacefully without anybody being hurt. So that was a hugely important objective for me. I didn't want to be a person responsible for making Canada a place where people, and you have heard by now there were reports of children, would actually get hurt in our efforts to protect the country. That was wrong. And I felt so strongly we had to look for ways to resolve this, yes, that was urgent, but not physically hurting anyone, and look, especially not a change, but anyone was a really key objective for me. And that -- so that was one key thing, and that is -- was the consideration that very much shaped the development and use of the financial measures. From my perspective at the time, and also with hindsight, a virtue of these measures was no blood on the face of a child, no physical coercion required, and I thought that it was good that we came up with a way of creating some economic incentives for people to leave. So that was a very important consideration. And -- yeah. And a second really important consideration in this question, right, I think you're asking exactly the right question. It's the balance; right? I've talked a lot now about why it was such a big problem, why I think we needed to act. Are your actions kind of appropriate and proportionate? And I would say the other thing in my mind there was we needed to always have in our minds, yes, a concern about the number of people who would be restricted by these measures, but that always need to be -- needed to be balanced against an awareness of the number of people who would be protected by this action. So those were the things that I chiefly had in mind. And you know, I think at the end of the day, it was something like 280 accounts frozen. One of the reports I remember when we were at like 240 or 241 accounts frozen, my numbers won't be exact but I know you guys have all the numbers too, it was something like 57 people when we were at around 240. So I don’t have the exact figure of how many actual people, when we were at 280, but I think we have an idea of the ballpark. And so in my mind, I say okay, that I regret that that happened to those people, I really do. I would have prefer -- it was a serious thing; I would have preferred not to have had to do this. But in my mind, I weigh that against what I really believe is the tens -- hundreds of thousands of Canadian jobs and families that we protected. So that’s kind of a high-level thing. I can talk about donations and family members, if you’d like me to?",30-059-12,59,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-061-19,"Sure. I mean, what I was going to ask you, and maybe this will lead into it, but would it be fair to say, then, that -- if it’s put to you, you know, someone -- someone is at the protest in Ottawa and gets a call, “You’ve got to come home. They’ve frozen the account and I can’t pay the grocery bill,” in a sense, that is the measure doing exactly what it was designed to do, which is create an incentive for that person to have to go home and leave the protest. That is, in effect, exactly what the measure was trying to do because the purpose of it was to avoid a -- what you saw as a worse outcome, being an enforcement action that would have potentially violent aspects to it.",30-061-21,61,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So, you know, had it been possible, if we lived in a universe where, you know, it was possible that a joint -- a jointly held family account, the family members could still have access to it but the person doing the illegal activity didn’t, that would be great. But that’s not how these accounts really work. So the intention was not to apply -- to create any incentives on people who were not personally choosing to engage in this illegal activity. I accept that that may have happened to some people, but that wasn’t the intention. The intention was really clear -- and I think, broadly, it worked -- was to create non-violent, non-physical incentives for people to stop doing this illegal activity, which was hurting Canadians very much. And what I would also say is, you know, I would have loved it if we had made the announcement on February 14th that, “We are going to take this action unless you leave”; ideal outcome would have been if everyone had left that night and if none of the measures had actually had to be used. There was no desire -- there was no desire to be in any way punitive.

30-064-19,"What I remember being concerned about, and again, this isn't something that I wrote. It's something that Alex wrote, so I can't speak to his specific conveying of what I said to him and what I was concerned about. But once we put the measures in place, I knew this was an extraordinary action, the kind of thing that I hope only happens, you know, once in a generation. And I knew that Canadians were very focussed on what was happening and concerned about it. And it was very important for me, having taken this extraordinary step, to be as careful as possible in communicating what was happening, not to over-egg the pudding, not to stretch the truth. And I didn't want to make a flat statement that no small donors have had their accounts frozen, although I very much hoped that was the case. I didn't want to make that categorical statement unless I knew for sure that was the case, because I really did understand that we were, you know, in terra incognita, and it was really important for us to do everything we could to maintain public confidence of Canadians in their government, including the confidence of the Canadians who disagreed with us, maybe most of all the confidence of those Canadians. And so my skepticism was sort of about saying to my team, ""If I'm going to be in question period, if I'm going to be in a press conference, I only want to assert things that are absolutely true."" And the position I didn't want to be in was, to take this example of donations, I'm really glad that no small donors had their accounts frozen. That was a good outcome and the one that I hoped would be the case. But I also knew that things were happening in real time, and what I didn't want to have happen was for me to go out to say categorically and reassuringly, ""Don't worry, if you made a small donation, your account isn't going to be frozen,"" and then have someone show up and say, ""Well, actually, it was."" Because had that been the case and had I categorically asserted otherwise, then people who already had real doubts about our government would be feeling, wow, these guys are even lying to us.

You mentioned earlier, Minister Freeland, that one of the issues or one of the concerns you were hearing from the banks was being – that they were being put in the middle of this, essentially having to do some -- action having to be taken on their specific parts. As a corollary to that, -- I hope that’s the right document. If we go to the top of page 7? So there’s the banks themselves, and then there’s the issue of the bank employees themselves. So the people who are working there, who now essentially have become front-line officers in this particular area, you voice this at the -- this is the minutes of the February 19th IRG: “The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance noted that in conversations with the banks, she is hearing concerns around the safety of bank employees, especially tellers who work at branches who may be dealing with individuals who have had their accounts frozen.” So what were you conveying there?

It was important to me for them not to be exposed to any danger in all of this. And actually, one of the motivations for crafting the measures the way we did was to protect them. And you’ll remember in the document we looked at from that Sunday, February 13th, a concern one of the CEOs expressed is absent a clear government instruction to the banks, the banks would be held responsible and that that was not fair or appropriate. And I actually agreed with that. And my central concern was, you know, that some poor teller not get yelled at and be held responsible, and even be in a dangerous situation. And so that was part of the thinking behind having these measures, to give the banks, at all levels, including the tellers, the ability to say, “This is the government’s decision, it’s not my decision. If you’re angry at someone, you know, be angry at Chrystia Freeland. Don’t be angry at me.” And I think that’s appropriate.",30-067-04,67,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-067-28,"Okay. The next topic I want to ask you about is, as you know, the Commission -- part of the Commission’s mandate is to examine the necessity of the measures that were taken and whether the measures that were decided upon and chosen by your government were the correct measures in the circumstances. So you’ve identified, obviously, identified at the time, choking off funding as an important part of how to bring an end to what was going on in Ottawa and across the country, funding of the convoy, funding of protestors. We know that there were a number of actions being taken on that front by various actors. So in and around the time when the Emergencies Act was being considered by Cabinet, by the IRG, and by Cabinet, and by the Prime Minister, a number of things had already taken place. So just to list some of them, GoFundMe obviously had shut down the convoy’s campaign on February 4th. TD -- and by the way, all of these are listed in the crowdfunding overview report that you referenced earlier that I can take no credit for. But the TD had frozen accounts on February 10th, I believe, and the Attorney General of Ontario had obtained a restraint order and the Mareva injunction process was in play and was eventually obtained on February 17th. So all this to say, there were various measures being taken by others designed to achieve a similar end, choking off the funding. And in light of that, and knowledge of what was going on in that area, why did you conclude that it was still necessary for the government to do what it did with the economic measures?",30-067-30,67,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-069-03,"It’s a good question, and something that we thought about a lot, and we were constantly assessing. And so one of the things I think worth bearing in mind is, you know, sitting here today, we kind of are judging a period of time that’s frozen, whereas as we were making the decisions, we were making the decisions in real time as things were evolving. It’s a real difference in perspective. And I’ve been struck by it myself as I have reviewed documents to get ready for today. In that real-time process, you know, I can’t emphasize too much the extent to which our preference, everyone’s preference, would have been for the actions to stop the blockades and occupation, without the Emergencies Act needing to be invoked. That was overwhelmingly what we would have preferred to do. It is a measure of last resort. We understood it to be a measure of last resort. And we would have preferred not to have needed to resort to it. So on the financial side of things, we were constantly looking and seeing, okay, are the tools that are currently in place good enough, effective enough? And that was one reason, from my perspective, that I convened that call of the banks’ CEOs on February 13th. And what you’ll see in that call that we’ve gone over already is they were very clear that the measures were not enough. And there was one CEO there who talked about how very specifically they had identified an account, they went to get the court order, but by the time they did, just four hours had passed, and the money had moved. And that -- it is certainly consistent with my understanding of the financial system as moving faster than the legal system can move. The other concern, which was also raised on that call, which I was very alive to, was the inappropriateness of putting the onus on the banks, including the tellers that we’ve spoken about, about acting, that this had become a very politicized space and they felt, and one of the CEOs said in that conversation on Sunday, “We are being seen in taking this measure as having taken a political position.” And I thought it was really legitimate for them to say, “It’s not our job to make a political judgement here. You are the elected government. It’s your job. And it’s your job to bear that responsibility.”",30-069-05,69,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-071-05,"So on FINTRAC, as we said we would do on February 14th, this was the case of this crisis causing us, you know, to review out toolbox and kind of saying, “Okay. We’re missing a screwdriver.” And it turned out we couldn’t, I don’t know, build the screwdriver in time to use it in this situation, but we were missing a screwdriver, we identified that, and we said on February 14th, you know, “This is a gap we’ve identified. We’re going to fill the gap.” And we did in fact go ahead and do that. So FINTRAC now has those authorities, and that’s a good thing. As it happened in this sort of fast-moving situation, the way FINTRAC works means there was a lag time between those authorities being granted to FINTRAC -- not granted, being sort of put there in the measures, and that actually being actionable and meaningful in this specific case. I judge that to be a good thing because it meant that things came to an end quite quickly. But I also judge, as we judged at the time -- and as we said very openly to Canadians, and I don’t think there’s actually a lot of debate around this -- that it’s a good thing for FINTRAC to have this authority. So that’s FINTRAC. And it was also appropriate, as was the case, that in the Emergency Measures, that specific extra power was limited just to the time of the -- just to the actions and the measures, it wasn’t a universal granting. We went back with regulatory changes to give that authority to FINTRAC in a permanent way. And I think Isabelle Jacques has explained that -- you know, I guess theoretically a person can say, “Well, why not just take that regulatory action on February the 14th or February the 15th, right away rather than put it in the Emergency Measures?” And regulation just takes longer to fully develop and to do properly. But that was always the intention, and we did it, and I think that’s good. On the insurance, from my perspective, it actually is good that we put it in place, and it’s good that we didn’t have to use it. You will have seen in some of the previous -- in some of the previous documents you’ve discussed with me, and in some of previous testimony, that a huge preoccupation was tow trucks. I think Canadians will not forget Premier Kenney’s comments about tow trucks, for example. And it's something that I raised with Brian Deese. It was, like, this serious thing; you know, for lack of a tow truck, the economy was wrecked, right; for lack of a nail, a kingdom was lost. It was that kind of a situation. It all came down to lack of tow trucks. The insurance measure I saw, and I see, as like a virtual tow truck. It was specifically designed to create an incentive for the trucks to move. And I think it did. And there was news reporting at the time that suggests that some people moved their trucks because they saw the insurance measure was there; we were very public about it being there, and that that created an incentive to leave. And that’s what we wanted to have happen. I see the fact that it didn’t ever have to be used as a feature, not a bug. Again, from my perspective, the less action we had to actually take, the less we had to actually use these measures, the better. If the measures had been effective purely upon being announced, creating a deterrent and an incentive for people to leave, and if that had happened in 24 or 48 hours, and no accounts had been frozen, that would have been a wonderful outcome.",30-071-07,71,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-074-11,"Sorry. So Perrin Beatty is the head of the Chamber of Commerce. He is a person with whom I have now worked closely for a long time; during the NAFTA negotiations, also during the COVID recession when we were working on our economic response. He was particular -- he is someone who I -- whose collaboration I really value, of course, because he represents the Chamber and Canadian small business, and that’s an important constituency for the Department of Finance, obviously. But also because Perrin is a former Conservative Cabinet Minister, and in fact is the guy originally responsible for the Emergencies Act. But in his capacity as sort of a former Conservative Cabinet Minister, I do think that where possible, it’s really good for a Liberal government to try to have good relationships, good working conversation with former Conservative Ministers, to understand that point of view; to, you know, I fully understand that we’re talking now about a very strong action we took, which was polarizing for the country, for -- which spoke to a time of polarization in the country. But Perrin specifically, for me, is an example of a person with whom I work hard to maintain a relationship because I think where we can have consensus in Canada, where we can work cross-partisan lines -- and we can’t always do that, but where we can, I think that’s good for the country.",30-074-13,74,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

There are also lots of long-term issues we need to consider once this is over, including whether we need to take other measures that could obviate the need to use the extraordinary powers in the Act in the future, and how to repair holes in our political system.

30-079-12,"So that brings me to the very last question I want to ask you, Minister, which is this is something that's been touched on already in the Inquiry. We haven't really spoken about it yet today. But if you look at the section 58 explanation, and I'm not going to pull it up because it's nothing specific, but in reporting to Parliament about why the Act was invoked, much of that explanation focusses on economic security and the threats to, as we've talked about today, Canada's economy that we're -- and this has been now the discussion for about two hours today. What is the link, as you see it, between the threat to economic security and the threat to national security? Because that link is not necessarily obvious in looking at legislation, and I'd really like to hear, we would really like to hear your perspective on that question.",30-079-14,79,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY(cont’d),MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-079-27,"Yeah, thank you for the question, and I say that really sincerely. I think that is a really important question, and a serious and challenging one. You know, people could write books about it, maybe someone can write a PhD thesis about it one day. But I will try to offer two links that are central in my own thinking, and were at the time. The first is I really do believe our security as a country is built on our economic security, and if our economic security is threatened all of our security is threatened. And I think that's true for us as a country, and it's true for individuals. It's true for the people who work in a Windsor car plant and who, you know, in some dystopian counterfactual let's imagine that we hadn't acted, let's imagine that this had entirely spiralled out of control, let's imagine that immediate trade in the car sector had been imperilled and that the Americans just sort of said, ""you know what, we just can't do this building of cars together with you guys, you're too unreliable."" So you know, the people who would have lost their jobs there, the people in a steel mill in Hamilton who would lose their job as that relationship fell apart. The people in aluminum smelter in Quebec. For each of those people, having this all fall apart and the country's economy become profoundly undermined, that would undermine their security and it would undermine our security as a country. And if that seems too abstract, I think you're seeing it today in the geopolitical space, where we're actually seeing economic tools being weaponized in actual wars. I spoke yesterday with the Prime Minister of Ukraine because we're issuing sovereignty bonds. It's a good thing that Canada is doing. I -- it's good. But I spoke with him yesterday, and he was talking to me in the darkness because most of Ukraine's power and water had been taken out by Russian missiles. Now, I'm not saying that we're talking about missiles with Canada, but I'm saying that a tool being used to undermine Ukraine is directly going at its economy. And we're seeing something similar happening in Europe, where energy supply to Europe, entirely an economic measure, is being used to undermine Europe's security. So I do think that an attack on, or an undermining of a country's economy, that can fundamentally undermine that country's national security. There's a second aspect which I was really worried about, which is maybe less kind of highfalutin and philosophical and more human and specific. And what I was worried about was, you know, it sounds -- it can sound very abstract to say economic security can undermine national security, to say geoeconomics is a tool in geopolitics, but actually that's not that complicated. And I think that while these illegal blockades and occupation were going on, I think actual ordinary Canadians, who do not debate these concepts in their ordinary lives, were feeling their own security to be undermined and were getting really angry. And one thing that I was worried about, I've mentioned that I was worried about in the ending of these blockades and occupation, I really didn't want anyone who was part of the blockade and occupation to be hurt. Another thing that was very much in my mind was the possibility of violent conflict between people doing the blockading and occupying and other Canadians who were very angry about it. I felt that Canada was sort of a powder keg and that you could have a violent physical confrontation at any point. I didn't visit Windsor at the time, but I heard a lot of people saying, you know this could really get out of hand. And the people of Windsor did really understand how important that trade over the Ambassador Bridge is, and I did really fear you could have counterprotests and a confrontation there, and that would’ve been terrible for the people involved and terrible for our country. And I was worried in Ottawa, also. And this is now just very sort of personal eye-witness experience. But I don’t normally have RCMP security, and I think that’s a good thing; I think that says something good about Canada. But the RCMP, they know what I’m doing everyday, and it’s their job to judge whether they think I need security or not. And I have to say to the RCMP officers who are here, who I recognize, they do a very good job of it, of making that judgment, I think. So a measure for me of how much Ottawa was a powder keg, was the fact that, I think from the end of January, the RCMP judged that I did need to have RCMP with me, just walking around. And so I didn’t feel personally in danger because the RCMP were taking care of me. But I do remember one morning -- and I’m sorry, I didn’t write it down in my notebook so I can’t tell you the date, but I remember one morning when I was walking from my hotel to my office, I walked past a parked truck and there was a young woman walking there too. And the truck honked really loudly, and she shouted something not very nice and made an obscene hand gesture, and the truck honked again really loudly. And I was really glad that I was there, and more importantly, that the RCMP was there, because I thought this is exactly the kind of thing -- like, imagine no-one had been there, it was just this small, young woman, and this big truck, and a person in it. And she was mad, and I just thought, you know, there are dozens and dozens of these things happening every day, and you know, God forbid that one of them should actually flare into violence and physical harm. So I was worried about that too, and that does speak to the economic challenge because many, many Canadians, while this was happening, understood that this -- for them, this threat to Canada’s economic security, for many, many Canadians, it was a personal threat to them, and they felt that their government was not protecting them. And they were right, we weren’t, for a while. And it was a real danger, I think, that that totally understandable and reasonable feeling that, “My economic security is being undermined by these illegal blockades and occupation. My government isn’t taking care of me, maybe I have to take care of myself.” And that would have been terrible, had that happened. That’s why we have a government.",30-079-29,79,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY(cont’d),DEPUTY PM CHRYSTIA FREELAND,deputy pm chrystia freeland

And today in your evidence, you talked about the economic and financial consequences of the protests. You talked about the reputational damage to Canada as an investment destination.

If you can just pause there. So the CSIS Act defines threats to the security of Canada, and we've heard evidence in this Commission that, for the purposes of invoking the Emergencies Act here, the focus was on (c). That's where they were focussed on in terms of the threats to the security of Canada. So what (c) says is, ""activities within or relating to Canada directed toward or in support of the threat or use of acts of serious violence against persons or property for the purpose of achieving a political, religious or ideological objective within Canada or a foreign state...""

30-117-25,"So that was my first stage. Second stage is in terms of, you know, one of the things that this Commission is I think quite rightly investigating, you know, was the government acting within its authorities. For me, as Finance Minister, an important factor in the judgment I came to, which is that we were, was the expert advice that we received. I'm not a lawyer. I rely on the judgment of officials who advised us and on expert legal advice. And I say that even as I am very confident that it was the right decision and confident in taking personal political responsibility. I can also speak to what I saw and experienced and believed that falls within the scope of the serious violence against persons or property point. But I do want to be clear that I'm not speaking here as someone with an expert legal opinion, but I'm speaking as a Minister who made a political judgment and as someone who was also in Ottawa. So some of the things that factored into my thinking about it were, as I described in my testimony this morning, a real concern that we were in a tinderbox situation, where the economic threats and the threats generally, that -- and the damage that were being created both by the Ottawa occupation and the Ambassador Bridge did risk, I felt at every moment, some kind of conflict between protesters and counter-protesters. I saw that and experienced it myself just being a person who was in Ottawa. I felt it was a tinder keg that could be sparked at any moment and was therefore very dangerous.

What I also said is, as a person who was here in Ottawa, I did see a real danger of violence. And then finally, what I described in my testimony this morning was the way in which the economic security of our country, I really believe, is a part of our national security, but that was a much broader conversation we were having about a broad set of issues, which I certainly think are important for us to think about and consider.",30-119-27,119,27,25,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

I apologize, for the transcript, my name is Mandy England and I'm one of the lawyers for the Government of Alberta. As has been discussed today, you had consultations with the CEOs of several banks on February the 13th about potential economic measures, and you said in your testimony today how important it was for you to hear from the leaders of the financial institutions, what their views were on the situation with the blockades. And as you're also aware, consultation with the first ministers of the provinces and territories was held on the morning of February 14th, and that was after the Cabinet meetings and the IRG meetings had been held. Now, consulting with the CEOs of financial institutions for their views on the situation is not required by the Emergencies Act before the government can invoke the Act for a Public Order Emergency, but consulting with the provinces and territories for their input is required. As deputy prime minister, don’t you think that the input of the first ministers of the provinces and territories on the potential invocation of the Emergencies Act and the proposed measures would have been relevant information to have before you at the IRG meetings and the Cabinet meetings where the invocation of the Emergencies Act was discussed and debated?",30-131-30,131,30,28,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

In this particular situation, it was a very complex fast-developing situation, and each minister was responsible for managing a series of relationships and bringing that information to the table. My colleague, Dominic LeBlanc, is an extremely able minister, an extremely able Intergovernmental Affairs minister, and I relied on him, as did everyone around the table, to manage that relationship and to bring to us and to the table his knowledge of the views of the provinces and territories.",30-133-03,133,3,1,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And then the -- there's a paragraph that begins ""First"", and then the next little paragraph says: ""The RCMP has told [us] they have heard from protesters as they were leaving the blockades that they did so because their families said their accounts were frozen, so get the hell out of there. This is a much better and peaceful way to end things."" Now, freezing someone's bank account without due process engages their personal rights, and it also engages the personal rights of the families that shared many of those bank accounts, individuals who weren't even at the protest. You stated here in this document that your view was that this is better and more peaceful, presumably than using the existing legal authorities, which multiple branches of law enforcement have testified at this Inquiry were adequate to bring a peaceful end to the protests, and indeed they did so using those authorities. So do you still hold that view today, that freezing the accounts was a better solution than law enforcement carrying out its legal authorities in the responsible manner that they do?",30-134-27,134,27,25,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

30-135-21,"The view that I do hold, as we discussed earlier today, is one of my very grave concerns about bringing these illegal blockades and this illegal occupation to an end was the danger that there would be violence, and that there would be violence directed towards the protesters. I was particularly concerned because of reports that children were present. And that was one of the reasons that I felt the financial tools that were put in place by the Emergencies Act were a better option. From my perspective, the job of these tools was to create a peaceful, non-violent incentive for people who were doing something illegal to leave. And I think those tools did work.",30-135-23,135,23,21,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. MANDY ENGLAND,DEPUTY PM CHRYSTIA FREELAND,deputy pm chrystia freeland
30-136-06,"And so I would just remind you in that regard that the call that we're looking at, this readout from in front of us, was held on February the 21st.

We have Monday, February the 21st, and you say, it's: ""Hard to believe that it was only a week ago that we were on a call...last Sunday..."" Which was February the 13th, ""talking about this."" So this is a call that was held on February the 21st after the enforcement actions had been taken out at Coutts, which were done before the Emergencies Act was invoked, after the Ambassador Bridge was cleared, which was before the Emergencies Act was invoked, and while the enforcement efforts in Ottawa were well underway, and you would have had the knowledge at that time that there was peaceful resolution by law enforcement at both of those border blockades, and that there was no violence against children and it was a peaceful resolution by law enforcement in Ottawa. And so with respect to those comments about the fear of the prospect of violence, I don't know that on the timeline of February 21st are you saying you still had them then and you would still have those today?",30-136-08,136,8,6,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

30-137-15,"No problem. It can be hard on the video calls. So on February 21st, when I made those comments, it was looking back on the events of the week that had passed, and I certainly believed then and I believe today that the financial tools we put in place aided in peaceful resolution of all of those occupations and blockades. The reports that we heard, the reports that were in the media, the reports from law enforcement were that many people did leave as a result of the incentives created by those tools. And then the final thing that I think is important to emphasise is we said on February 14th ""we are putting these tools in place so please leave now so that these tools never need to be used."" So any person who had their account frozen had due warning that they were engaged in illegal activity and that they should stop doing that activity. And the other thing that I would point to that I think did work well is the accounts were very quickly unfrozen after the illegal activity ceased.",30-137-17,137,17,15,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And if you look at the second installation of the thread, or the second part of the thread, it says: “It doesn’t matter if it’s an adversary or an ally -- we can’t be this reliant on parts coming from foreign countries.” Was that the comment that you were referencing earlier in your testimony?",30-153-28,153,28,26,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

30-154-12,"Yes, it was. And I remember when that came out very, very clearly. And what was being publicly said by U.S. officials, all of it worried me. But I think if I had to identify for people here one particular line that worried me the most, it’s those two sentences. And in particular: “It doesn’t matter if it’s an adversary or an ally -- we can’t be this reliant on parts coming from foreign countries.” That is a huge threat to Canada’s entire auto sector. And the point especially there that she’s underscoring, “adversary or ally”, because a point that we had been making, and actually, we had made successfully, for example, with the 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, was those were inappropriately levied against Canada by the U.S. because we were an ally. And so you could rely on us. And that point there is saying, “You know what? You shouldn’t differentiate between, for example, Canada and China. The United States is equally at risk if it has an economic dependency.” And having U.S. elected representatives assert that publicly and connect it to this blockade and say, “Look, by relying on Canada, you’re going to lose your job,” that was very, very dangerous for us. And I will also point out this was a democratic member of the Michigan delegation. And I think later on in the Tweet, Representative Slotkin talks about being in touch with the White House. These were the people that the White House was talking to about this situation, but also about the EV incentives.

30-155-26,"And so then if we go to February 10th, that’s day four of the blockades, Commission Counsel mentioned earlier that the Department of Finance prepared an economic analysis on February 10th, that day. We looked at it the other day with the Department of Finance officials. That background noted that by the -- at that time, as of the fourth day, there were auto plant shut downs at Ford, Stellantis, and Toyota plants that were caused by the Ambassador Bridge blockade.

And we spoke earlier this morning about my conversation that day, the 10th of February, with Brian Deese, where he said, and I can’t recall exactly, but something like another 12 hours and all the northeast will shut down. So I was aware of the impact. And at some level, I wasn’t surprised, because I did know -- I knew two things, that the auto sector is so hugely integrated and, you know, the U.S. plants are dependent on us, but we’re also dependent on the U.S. plants. Those parts go across six times; right? So I knew that. And the other thing, which I think Rhys Mendes spoke to you guys about, but is very true, is the auto sector operates on a just in time production process. They don’t like to hold big stores of parts because that’s expensive. And so the industry requires very reliable and very speedy supply chains, and if there’s a break in them, yes, it stops production. So I knew that intellectually. I would say though, at a kind of emotional level, it still, you know, was breathtaking how quickly it had happened, how quickly the effect mounted, how swift the political impact was, and I think that was the case also for the White House. And that was reflected in my Brian Deese conversation, where he sort of said, “Yeah, you’ve been telling us about the integration, but now I really see it.”",30-156-11,156,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

30-158-25,"I have. The -- and I'll give you a couple of examples. PDAC is a big annual Toronto mining conference. If you're in the mining industry you will have heard of it, it's famous among miners, and Canada is rightly proud to host it every year and to be the mining capital of the world. PDAC this year, because of COVID restrictions, it's normally held in the winter but it was held in June, and at PDAC in Toronto in June, Jonathan Wilkinson, the Minister of Natural Resources, and I convened a table to talk about critical minerals and metals, and electric vehicles. And one thing that really struck me was -- and we had sort of miners there, processors, and also car companies and car parts people, sort of the full circle of that sector. One of the people there, the Canadian CEO of a Japanese car company, proactively, so went around the table, everyone raised their points about critical minerals and metals and EVs and opportunities in Canada. And this CEO, who, you know, is a guy whose job is to get his Japanese headquarters to invest in Canada, and he raised in his remarks, I think it was the first thing he said, ""I'm still getting questions around the blockades and the occupation. And I need to be able to say to my headquarters in Japan that this is not going to happen again in Canada. That they can be confident that that access to the U.S. market is not going to be impeded."" So that was very striking to me, that still in June, even after our action, which worked, there were still those lingering concerns, and it made me glad that we had acted when we did and not later. And then in -- just in October, I was in Winsor, which we've heard so much about earlier today, speaking about the economy, actually at a big car parts event, and one of the car industry journalists asked me a question, and I'm -- you know, it's on the public record exactly what he said, but I'm just recalling broadly. His question was basically, ""Can you offer assurances that something like the convoy and the blockade won't happen again? It continues to be a major concern in the car industry here."" And again, I was surprised that someone in October was still asking the question, and it was further evidence to me of how serious the threat had been. And you know, while taking very seriously the magnitude of our action and the reluctance that any government should have on ultimately acting as we did, that question was a confirmation for me that there was very great harm that was in the process of being done, and I was glad that we acted to stop the harm.",30-158-27,158,27,25,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

They did not feel the situation was under control. We did not discuss with them specific measures. I was sort of in listening mode, apart from kind of saying to them, you know, “Buck up, gentlemen, and do tell your investors that Canada is great,” and sort of wanting to give them confidence in our leadership. But, as you have seen from the transcript, they volunteered a number of them -- two things: one, grave concern about the economic situation, and two, absolute concern, and I would even say frustration, that the tools available to them were both inadequate. You remember from that transcript, there was the point made of, “We tried to get a court order but it took four, and by the time we tracked it down, the money had moved to another account.” And then also the concern, which I take seriously, about the banks being concerned that acting absent some form of government instruction would put them in jeopardy, the Fox News point that was there.",30-162-05,162,5,3,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

And the other thing that I will say there is it's not in the ordinary way of things for leaders of big Canadian businesses to want the government to do more in the economy. I would say, quite the contrary. And at this particular moment, the banks had reason to not be so happy about things the government was doing. This followed our election, during which we had campaigned on the 15-percent Covid-recovery dividend which would be levied on banks and financial institutions, and we had campaigned on a permanent tax on the banks. So I would guess -- and you could speak to them, but I would guess that if you had spoken to the bank’s CEOs at the beginning of January and said, “Would you like the Liberal Government to take a more active position when it comes to economic management of Canada,” they would say, “No, we wouldn’t like that, and we would certainly like them not to impose these taxes.” So I just say that because the fact that they were saying the tools were not adequate and, “You need to do more,” was particularly compelling to me because they were not a constituency that was inclined to seek strong government action in the economy.",30-162-30,162,30,28,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

And so having Fox News attack you isn’t a problem only because Canadians might be watching, but if you have a big US operation, it’s a problem because your American customers will be watching.

And some of my questions will be directed at one of you specifically because it's something that's within your personal knowledge, or a document or a communication that you were involved in, and some of them I will throw out more generally, and the person best placed can answer. And you can also feel free if it's appropriate and you have knowledge to add to someone else's answer, you're free to do that. So the first question I think I'll address to Ms. Telford, which is just can you explain the mandate and the structure at a very sort of general level of the Prime Minister's Office? What does the Prime Minister's Office do?",30-168-26,168,26,24,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-169-10,"The Prime Minister's Office, we serve at the pleasure of the Prime Minister, which is different than our public service colleagues in the sense that job security is a little different. We work between elections as well, and many of us, though not all of us, do take leaves during election campaigns to work on election campaigns. But in-between elections and working in government, our role is to facilitate information to the Prime Minister, to facilitate his ability to make the best decisions he can to advance the agenda that he was elected on by Canadians. So that includes everything from very operational work. So we have teams of tour advance people, as we call them. We have regional desks who coordinate with stakeholders, including different levels of government in different parts of the country. I'm sure my colleagues can speak to -- John is our Director of Policy and can speak to the Policy Team. Brian Clow is one of two Deputy Chiefs of Staff in the Prime Minister's Office, the other Deputy Chief of Staff is Marjorie Michel. And the other Chief of Staff, since she is not here, is primarily responsible for a lot of the operational elements of the office ranging from human resources because we are an office of roughly a hundred, and -- so the human resources side. The public appointments as well, there's hundreds and thousands of public appointments that go through government, and so we act as a coordinating body in many ways on the political side between ministers' offices as well. And -- but our primary job is getting the Prime Minister the information that he needs, getting him the best advice from all parts of government, but also from outside of government that he needs to be able to accomplish what he committed to Canadians he would do if he were elected.",30-169-12,169,12,10,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-170-18,"So I view my role in two ways: There's the day-to-day management role. So I manage the Prime Minister's Office, and I have an extraordinary group of people who work day and night, particularly during this time period they did. And -- so it's all the sort of operational scheduling and day-to-day management you can imagine of running an office of that size, as well as coordinating between other ministers' offices as well. So we have a weekly Chief of Staff meeting that involves the Chiefs of Staff from all of the ministers' offices across government as a way of touching base and sharing information, sometimes best practices. And then the other hat I wear at the same time is being a senior advisor to the Prime Minister, and in terms of bringing him the best advice I can from everywhere I can, but also facilitating people being able to get in front of him and provide him with all the advice and the inputs that he needs to make the best decisions he can for Canadians.",30-170-20,170,20,18,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-171-10,"Sure. So as Director of Policy, one of the key pieces of my role is to kind of work with the Privy Council Office very closely to coordinate the Cabinet agenda. So as you've heard through these proceedings, there's - - we have many Cabinet committees, and -- so we work with PCO to make sure items are ready to go forward on those agendas, any kind of remaining issues to be sorted out between ministers or departments, so that's one. We have a team of 14 policy advisors. So they cover the -- all the departments. So they each have policy files, so they become, you know, the links to the ministers' offices as well as to the content experts at PCO and other departments. And I think in that role, we provide advice to the Prime Minister on policy items, so whether it's items going to Cabinet, other items such as the budget, our team will often prepare memos along those lines and advise the Prime Minister on the policy side of these things.",30-171-12,171,12,10,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MR. JOHN BRODHEAD,john brodhead
30-171-27,"Okay. And we're going to come back in a minute to -- you mentioned PCO. And we've heard from a few witnesses last week from PCO, so we're going to come back to the interplay a little bit between your office and PCO. But first, I'll just ask Mr. Clow to introduce himself and describe his role.",30-171-29,171,29,27,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-172-06,"So I am one of two Deputy Chiefs of Staff, as Katie laid out, and I oversee five teams in the office. One is the Policy Team, which John described; second is the Communications Team, it's the largest of the five. They do exactly what their name says, press releases, all government communications and media relations for sure. Quite a range of activities in that department. There is -- third, is the Issues Management and Parliamentary Affairs Team. That's one unit. So everything that goes through Parliament, whether it's legislation, votes in the House, debates in the House, the PMO Parliamentary Affairs Team engages in that space. But they also focus on Issues Management, which I like to think of it as the government has its proactive agenda, which is largely driven out of the Policy Team, and then the Issues Management Team deals with day-to-day developments, whatever comes at us. So certainly the Issues Management Team was involved in what's being studied here quite early on. And then there are two more units that I oversee, they're smaller units. One is the Global Affairs Team. They focus on all -- any number of international files. And finally, there's a unit that was created a couple of years ago to deal with the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",30-172-08,172,8,6,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And I should mention that the reason you've all been selected to be here today is you were all involved in some way in assisting the Prime Minister in responding to the events of late January and February that are before the Commission. Certainly not just you, but certainly all of you. So just going back to that question of the interplay between PCO and PMO, I'm not sure who's best placed to speak to that between the three of you, but Mr. Brodhead, you brought it up, so maybe we'll start with you.",30-173-03,173,3,1,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-173-13,Yeah. So the lines of communication and the interaction between the public service and the political side in advising the Prime Minister.,30-173-15,173,15,13,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-173-16,"Sure. So I'll speak to my experience because I obviously cover one part of that dynamic. And I interact with primarily two parts of the Privy Council Office. One is the kind of Priorities and Planning Group, which is Michael Vandergrift's group, and then the other one is the Operations Team, which is now run by Kaili Levesque. Plans and Priorities is really the Cabinet side, and Operations is more of the execution and -- of that. So there is, I would say, a constant flow of information back and forth. They provide us advice, they convene meetings of departments across the government, they really kind of hold the institutional knowledge on many of these files, and so we kind of work very closely together to ensure we're aligned on the policy agenda, that things are rolling out. They also have great experience in terms of execution of policy, so it's are things getting done, are things happening that we brought into play, are they still going, is it still moving? So it's a very constant and a very important relationship for us.",30-173-18,173,18,16,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MR. JOHN BRODHEAD,john brodhead
30-174-06,"Ms. Telford, do you have anything to add to that in terms of the lines of communication and providing advice to the Prime Minister?",30-174-08,174,8,6,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-174-09,"I would just add that, and I'm sure you heard this from the Clerk, who is -- who I have primarily the most contact with is with the Clerk and the National Security and Intelligence Advisor, and to only a slightly lesser degree, the Deputy Clerk. And they're also the ones who have the most contact with the Prime Minister. And so the Clerk meets with the Prime Minister on a very regular basis, often meets with the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister together, and I will attend the majority of those meetings as well. And there is -- and then she and I will talk regularly in between those meetings as well in terms of planning out, you know, what needs to get covered and what's going on, and prioritising who else we might need in those meetings. And so as John said, it's a very regular flow of information back and forth. But -- and that's true for the entire Prime Minister's Office. Everybody has counterparts of one kind or another on the public service side, and the flow of information is significant, though we do have clearly different roles in terms of what our responsibilities are to the Prime Minister, and of course, as I said earlier, how we're employed.",30-174-11,174,11,9,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-175-02,"Thank you. Okay, with that introduction out of the way, we'll turn to the matters before the Commission. And starting with the very early days of the convoy, can you describe to us when PMO first became aware that the convoy was a thing that was possibly rolling into Ottawa, what your initial impressions of it were, what your sources of information were and the sort of prearrival early days.",30-175-04,175,4,2,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-175-10,"So the week of January 17th, there were a few interactions. On Monday, January 17th, there was a report sent from PCO to PMO. I think one or two people in the Prime Minister's Office -- it might have actually come from a Minister's office as a flag that there were some slow roll activity in Emerson, Manitoba. At that point though, that information was not shared beyond that. It was just one of any number of issues. As the week went on though, we started to hear more and see more reports of the convoy protest. On Thursday, January 20th, there was an email that came from PCO to a number of people in PMO that laid out -- it was an update on the convoy protest. I think it was focussed on -- it named three places specifically: Coutts, North Portal, Saskatchewan, and Ottawa. And the update also included a press release from the Canadian Trucking Alliance, which condemned the convoy activity, specifically proposed unlawful activity, which even at that point, there -- what was coming out of a number of the speakers was proposed unlawful activity and road blockages specifically. So it was that week January 17th when we started to hear about this. That weekend, I'd say 22nd, 23rd, by then, it was on everybody's radar. The week of the 24th is when the Prime Minister started to get updated daily on it.",30-175-12,175,12,10,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MR. BRIAN CLOW,brian clow

30-176-25,"That's right. Intelligence Secretariate. Okay. So Mike MacDonald is explaining and briefing, essentially, on what the state of knowledge there is at the time. So he says, ""Latest lay of the land -- security, coordination, [National Security] apparatus -- what do we know? Law enforcement across the country is learning more about the convoy and its organizers as they interact with them."" And then there's some description of where it's coming from. The next bullet down says, ""Actively monitoring -- one thing they're picking up on is chatter on social media. So far, RCMP telling us that the convoy itself is peaceful, not causing problems along the way. Their goal is to get to Ottawa, not have infractions along the way."" And then, ""Very small online chatter. That's where people are using disturbing language."" Mr. Clerk, if you can just keep scrolling to the next page, please? There we go. ""Following Jan[uary] 6[th] events last year..."" Which is a reference to January 6th in Capitol Hill in the United States, ""...NSIA worked with PPS, RCMP and sergeant at arms for a scenario planning for regular protests, pushed boundaries and plan out for things like an insurrection. This has been done."" Then, ""Ottawa Police and PPS have an MOU, have done exercises for these types of protests [...] On the federal side, we have governance in place that is up [and] running.

30-178-16,"So I wasn't a part of this specific brief, but received this email. And so I have no reason to believe it doesn't represent what was discussed there. But I would say it's only a piece of the picture of what we were watching at that time. There's a reference in there to social media chatter and disturbing comments. And by this point, it was a very significant issue and getting a lot of coverage in media, some of those comments. This email was sent on January 25th, which is the same day it was reported in media that some individuals who were planning to participate in the demonstration were saying they wanted this to be their January 6th. That's why you see -- I suspect you see this in this email summary because there were individuals explicitly referencing January 6th. And at this point as well, it was known in public that some people planning to participate in the demonstration had a proposal to replace the government by going to the Governor General and the Senate. It's otherwise known as the MOU.",30-178-18,178,18,16,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MR. BRIAN CLOW,brian clow

We did some planning after January 6th and things are sort of under control and the machine is operating as it should. But then Ms. Astravas raises a concern saying the Ministers are actually pretty worried about this.

Is there -- unless there's anything else you'd like to add about what was going on prearrival, but then chronologically, the next thing that happens is the convoy arrives and doesn't leave when everyone expected it to do, and then we head into the first week of the protest, if we can call it that. So I'd like you to pull up now, Mr. Clerk, SSM.NSC.CAN00002941. And as that's being done, maybe I can ask you to just describe to us from your point of view what that first week was like and what was going on from your perspective in attempting to respond. And the notes I'm pulling up here are Mr. Clow's notes from a February 3rd meeting, which I think can fairly be described as a brainstorming ideas kind of meeting. But before we get into the specifics of the notes, can you fill in a bit of the narrative of what was happening in your thinking in your office at the time?",30-180-13,180,13,11,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-181-01,"So we watched the convoy arrive, not only in Ottawa, but there was activity in Coutts, very serious activity that first weekend. Emerson we're starting to see some blockages there. It's down to one lane and would open up again, some trucks would move, but there was activity in Emerson. So this was already a national issue in the first week. And we were -- we continued to see very concerning statements from some demonstrators, including from demonstrators and organizers that they were not going to leave until the government changed its policy. But in that first weekend, law enforcement was responsible -- local law enforcement I should say, and by the end of the weekend, it was clear they weren't leaving, so I would say concern had increased at the end of the weekend. So we in the Prime Minister's Office, with PCO, with Minister's offices, with caucus, with others, we were hearing a lot of concern and we were discussing internally and getting updates and sharing information with each other as best we could. Before this meeting on the 3rd, which was well into the second week, there had been a briefing of the Prime Minister by the National Security Advisor and the Clerk, so there were discussions happening. What happened on February 3rd and what these notes reflect is this was a Thursday. The second weekend was approaching, and law enforcement had not been able to contain the various protest. And, in fact, in my view, they were getting worse. So we assembled and basically covered the waterfront, what's going on, who's talking to who, what can we be doing more of, what are different provinces and municipalities asking, are different provinces and municipalities asking questions? And if they aren’t asking for support -- if they aren’t, can we have a conversation with them to see if they should be asking for support?

And I note, the NSIA reported that: ""Eleven (11) BC communities have protests, 35 across the country.""

So I would say there was lots of conversations happening at this point with various governments, at the officials’ level, at the political level, across the country, as we tried to make sure we were hearing from them on what was happening on the ground and making sure we had those -- that intelligence. I think -- with respect to Ontario, specifically, I think there was, at the outset, a different approach to this -- to the strategy, and I think, as we get to - - we were quite keen on this idea of a tripartite table that Minister Blair had been working on and we thought that was a good way of getting everybody at the table and making sure resources were aligned, making sure everyone, you know, looked each other in the eyes and worked together. And at that time, Ontario was not as keen on that approach. I don’t really want to, you know, speculate for why the Solicitor General or Deputy Minister Solicitor General at this point wasn’t, but from my conversations with them, they did want to have Ottawa -- the City of Ottawa and the Ottawa Police Service kind of play the lead role and were not as interested at that time in the collaborative tripartite approach that were interested in.",30-188-05,188,5,3,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-190-23,"Yeah. So previous to being Director of Policy, which I started in January, I was Senior Advisor with a focus on intergovernmental affairs. And so through that, I got to work closely with a number of the provinces. The three I was having most contact with, one was British Columbia because they were chair of the Council of Federation at the time, so that was an ongoing active discussion generally, and I want to be clear, not just about this. For example, Mr. Wallace and I were working on child care very actively at this time as well, and other issues were very -- would come up. So -- and then other provinces as well, but the other part of our PMO which is important in this is the regional desks who don’t report to me, they're part of the operations team.

So Ms. Telford, this is a text exchange between you and Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who we know is the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. And he writes to you and says, ""Just got this from Vandergrift."" So that’s a reference to his deputy minister, Michael Vandergrift. ""Minister, want to let you know that the Ontario solicitor general has again declined the invitation to attend the tripartite meeting today on the Ottawa occupation."" And you say, ""I think we need to let -- shine a light on that."" He says, ""We'll say it.""

This was obviously a further attempt at a meeting with the three levels of government, and Ontario was continuing to decline. I don’t recall when he says, ""We'll say it,"" where that meant, but in putting myself back in that time, I think when I'm saying we should shine a light on it, it's bringing some attention to the fact that Ontario wasn’t at the table and we really did believe it would be a more efficient and effective way to work.",30-192-12,192,12,10,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-192-23,"There was definitely some frustration because we believed it could be easier than it was, all things being very relative at that time. But there was ongoing communication with Ontario bilaterally throughout. It just meant that the conversations were happening between Ottawa and the federal government, the federal government and Ontario, Ontario and -- so there were just numerous bilateral conversations that we just thought could have been better handled and more efficient if we could have all just come together, because as I know has come up throughout the Inquiry, there was a fair bit of confusion around numbers and requests and the RFAs, the way they worked, the requests for assistance. They do need to go through the provincial level of government and so not having them as part of the conversation made things that bit more complicated.",30-192-25,192,25,23,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-193-10,"That’s fair. Mr. Clerk, can you please pull up ONT.00000159? So I'm going to ask you here about a meeting that was held on February 6th that was a sort of tripartite but not quite, between the City of Ottawa, federal government, and provincial government. And the exchange I'm going to take you to -- we've seen this document several times in the Commission, so I'm not going to go through the whole thing, but at the end of the document, there's an exchange between the national security advisor and the deputy solicitor general of Ontario that I'd like to get your take on. So it's February 6th, an 11 o'clock meeting attended by officials from three levels of government. So Mr. Clerk, if you can scroll down to the very bottom of the document you'll see it says there: ""Jody Thomas, National Security Advisor, noted that it was a positive meeting and regrets to end on this following point. Would the province be looking to the federal government if this protest was happening outside the City of Ottawa, e.g., happening in other places like Kingston?"" And the response from Mr. Di Tommaso was: ""This is a protest and encampment moving against the federal mandate on trucks. They came across -- they came to Ottawa from across the country for that purpose."" Mr. Di Tommaso testified at the Commission approximately two weeks ago and he expressed that in his view, Ms. Thomas' -- he interpreted Ms. Thomas' comment as -- I'll quote the words here, ""The federal government wanting to wash its hands of the entire matter."" And so I'd just like to get your reaction in terms of whether you think that was a fair assessment of what was going on, what do you think that that was, what was being expressed there, and what Ms. Thomas was trying to express when she said, ""Would this be -- would the province be looking to the federal government if this was somewhere other than Ottawa?""",30-193-12,193,12,10,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

I don’t -- I'm not putting too much weight into this as I read it, and I wasn’t there, but this strikes me as frustration and a bit of a back and forth and that frustration happening and both sides kind of articulating some of that frustration. I think we were trying to look for ways to work together. There were three levels of government and it was a challenge to get these machines working in the right direction. And I think this is a -- this back and forth is a -- would be my guess, would be this is an outcrop of just a frustration around those levels of government and the two different approaches that I've outlined before.",30-194-25,194,25,23,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-195-07,"Fair enough. And you can appreciate that one of the issues the Commission is looking into is the interaction between governments and -- which is not always an easy thing, but how it all played out here. Okay. So eventually, around this time, around the time of February 7th, 8th, 9th, Ontario became more engaged when the Ambassador Bridge blockade became entrenched and so we know that that has happened. And I'll take you with that point to the witness summary. I'm sorry, Mr. Clerk, it's WTS00000014, page 11. Oh, I'm sorry, 83. I'm sorry, I got the wrong number, 83. Fourteen (14) is the IR.

I think in a sense it started to become absolutely clear that we had to work together. So it was almost the increase of things happening to add the Ambassador Bridge to the Ottawa situation, other things starting to happen around the province; Windsor, Sarnia, Cornwall, and all -- I think it became clear -- and I’m hypothesizing here -- that -- but we did see an evolution of their strategy at that time. In terms of at the political level collaboration, I think there’s lots going on in other places that I don’t want to comment to, but just that’s what I would -- I can specifically comment to.",30-196-05,196,5,3,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

Leaving Ontario for a moment and talking about engagement with other provinces, I do want to ask you some questions about another topic that’s come up several times here, which is Alberta’s request for assistance. So I’m going to put to you a few facts that we know and that have come out already at the Commission, and that are also brought out in the PMO Institutional Report. So there’s a notation in your IR that PMO staff engaged with Pam Livingston.

30-197-08,"Okay. And there were two interactions, apparently, between PMO and Ms. Livingston about the Alberta request for assistance. And that request for assistance we’ve seen several times before, so no need to pull it up, but was for, essentially, assistance in tow trucks, in removing vehicles from the Coutts blockade. There’s also a notation that the Prime Minister had a formal call on February 6th with Minister Blair to discuss Alberta’s request for assistance and the ongoing situation. And then I’m going to pull up -- or ask the Clerk to pull up Mr. Clow’s notes again, SSM.NSC.CAN00002941. So this is the notation I said we’d come back to. This is the meeting that you’re having with the Prime Minister on February 6th, and the notation -- there it is, thank you: “Coutts persists, but traffic is moving. [Alberta] asked for RFA. We don’t see CAF being able to help to [with] that.” So at that point, it’s apparently been concluded, or decided in some form, that the Canadian Armed Forces is unable to assist; is that correct, Mr. Clow?",30-197-10,197,10,8,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-198-01,"So the RAF came in the day before that, and it immediately spurred a number of conversations with different offices; Ministers were consulted, and the Prime Minister was consulted on a few different occasions about this. And, yes, there was a general sense that CAF should be last resort. But also in this specific case, I think you’ve heard from other witnesses as well, but at the time, the discussion was that this was not -- this was not an appropriate, or even useful, response to what the problem was. And what I mean by that was, were these trucks actually going to be able to do the job? That was all part of that discussion that ensued after the request came in on the 5th.",30-198-03,198,3,1,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MR. BRIAN CLOW,brian clow

Why was this RFA treated quite differently than most are? This was elevated to the level of the PMO and the Prime Minister, which most requests for assistance are not. Can you explain or elaborate on that?",30-198-15,198,15,13,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-198-23,"Just -- and you may want to add to this, but we are usually made aware of requests for assistance, wherever they’re going in government. And in this case, we were obviously following everything to do with the blockades and the occupation very, very closely. And in this case, because the feedback from departments was coming that there wasn’t a way to help, and our -- what we were trying to do was support anybody who needed assistance on the ground. And so if Alberta was asking for help, we wanted to be able to support them. So it just led to a lot of conversations. It kind of comes to the role that our office often plays, of coordination and facilitation, because we then started reaching out and asking questions of other departments, saying, “Does anyone else have the equipment that they might be looking for? It may not be appropriate for CAF, and they may not have the equipment but is there that equipment somewhere else that could be found?” So I think as it says in the interview summary, you know, we even went so far as to say, “Does Parks Canada have this kind of thing?” Because the goal was to be able to assist if we could.",30-198-25,198,25,23,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

So it was -- and I kind of push back a little bit on that this rarely happens. Like, in a case where the process comes through and it goes to the Minister and it’s a -- I’ve known of other cases where it was like, “No, we can’t assist.” The Minister’s office will often flag it to us, and we’ll ask questions about while we explored this. And I can remember other instances where that was the case, where we just pushed more to find other solutions that in the kind of narrow band of the RFA process, they may not bother.",30-199-19,199,19,17,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-200-02,"Okay, that’s fair. It’s the request for assistance that we’re dealing with in the Commission, it’s the only one that we’ve seen this pattern in. But that’s a fair explanation. Okay. I now want to shift gears now and talk about what you were hearing during this process with various stakeholders and interlocuters, both nationally and internationally. So Mr. Clow, I’ll start with you. We know you had a few conversations with a man named Juan Gonzales, he’s the special advisor to President Biden. Can you tell us about those conversations, and what you were hearing from him?",30-200-04,200,4,2,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-200-14,"Yes. So I heard from Juan Gonzales. He is part of the national security team in the White House, and we’d interacted on a few files before the convoy protests. And he reached out, I believe on Wednesday, February 9th. At that point it was a request to connect National Security Intelligence Advisor Jody Thomas with the White House Homeland Security Advisor, to urgently discuss the Windsor blockade, but also other border blockades that were in effect at that time. So Juan and I had a bit of back and forth about that. That, then, led to a number of conversations, some of which you heard about this morning from the Deputy Prime Minister. But there were various interactions between the Prime Minister’s Office, PCO, several Ministers’ offices, and their counterparts in the United States, in the White House and different departments in the United States because they became seized with the border blockades that were impacting them quite significantly.",30-200-16,200,16,14,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-201-03,"So you mentioned that we heard this morning from the Deputy Prime Minister that she was hearing a lot of concern from officials in the United States about what was going on, and some encouragement, if we could put it that way, to bring a swift end, given the impact this was going to have on Canada-US relations and trade. Were you hearing similar concerns from the people you were talking to in the United States and/or in other countries?",30-201-05,201,5,3,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,shantona chaudhury
30-201-12,"Absolutely. And the concern was not only about trade, economics, dollars and cents; it was for sure but there was also a discussion in many of these conversations, including between the Prime Minister and the President, that both countries were facing similar forces in certain ways. For example, the United States also saw some convoy activity, I think it was dealt with quite quickly by the Americans but they saw a trucker protest heading to the Superbowl. There was one that was trying to be assembled to head to Washington, C.C. So these were a part of the conversations as well. It was viewed as a shared problem. But for sure, the immediate issue was the blockades at various border crossings, especially Windsor, and how do we sort these out quickly.",30-201-14,201,14,12,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-202-02,"Well, she was one of the key principals having interactions with the White House and various departments in the United States. And the substance -- you know, one example of substance within those conversations was how can we introduce measures to end the blockades, or at least dissuade them from growing and from new ones from popping up. For example, there was discussion of potential immigration measures or penalties placed on people who conducted unlawful activity at these border blockades. There was definitely discussion of whether the United States could provide tow trucks to help, given it was virtually impossible to get tow trucks on the Canadian side of the border. So that's the kind of thing that was discussed.",30-202-04,202,4,2,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS. SHANTONA CHAUDHURY,MR. BRIAN CLOW,brian clow

For months afterwards I can say, including up until recent summits though, this is a topic that continues to come up with counterparts from various countries. And the Prime Minister also had calls during the occupation with other world leaders where this was a topic that was coming up because they were watching what was happening in Canada and concerned that they were starting to see the same thing in some of their countries and they were concerned about copycat situations.

Millions of dollars came in from the United States, according to published reports. Chief Sloly announced that there were American citizens who had travelled to join the occupation in Ottawa. So that was also a feature of the discussions here. The flooding of 9-1-1 phone lines here in Ottawa came largely from Americans, as announced by Chief Sloly, and the Ottawa Police.

But I did write down and it was reported to us that Minister Blair had spoken to the Clerk about the Emergencies Act, and that was in the leadup I think just one day before the Incident Response Group meeting where the Emergencies Act was discussed in some detail, in addition to other things.

30-207-21,"I think as the Clerk may have spoken to already, and I think as these notes show too, the meetings were becoming increasingly frequent with added Ministers and different departments getting involved because of the request for assistance amongst a growing number of blockades now, as well as protests in different parts of the country and the occupation of course is now heavily entrenched in Ottawa. And so as we were having these meetings, the Clerk, I believe, advised the Prime Minister, though it made good sense to the group of us at the time as well that it was time to formalize our structure, moving forward and that we were at a point of national crisis and that’s what the Incident Response Group was put together for. It was a group that was -- it was a Cabinet committee that was created, I believe, in the first mandate of the government midway through, and it is chaired by the prime minister. It does not have a set permanent membership. It is convened with the ministers appropriate to whatever the incident is that is being discussed. And the thing that makes it very different from other Cabinet committees is where in another Cabinet committee it tends to be policy focused and over a longer term, this is obviously dealing with something in real time and something that’s crisis-like in nature. But the structural difference too is that officials lead in many ways the conversations within the IRG meetings space, and they are right at the table. So whereas at a Cabinet committee the ministers would be sitting around the Cabinet table and the officials might be sitting to the side, they may very well be making presentations and then the minsters would be discussing those presentations or they might speak to make clarification when their ministers call on them for that clarification. At an IRG meeting, the principal presenters are officials and so whether it's the NSIA, whether it's the commissioner of the RCMP, whether it was the head of CSIS, depending on the incident, in past, it might be the CAF and the chief of defence staff. And then the ministers are called on by the prime minister to add anything that they might see as not having been covered, to any thoughts they have on the basis of the information that’s been presented, but they are all sitting around the same table which makes it quite a different meeting than really any other.",30-207-23,207,23,21,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-209-12,I think for a number of reasons. It's their expertise and getting it in real time to the prime minister and to the ministers. And things are moving very quickly. And it's -- so it's an efficiency and an effective kind of tool to bring everybody to that same table and convene the leadership of the different security agencies for whatever the security incident is and to hear from people directly.,30-209-14,209,14,12,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-209-27,"Okay. Fair enough. So we've been through the content of many of the IRGs. One theme I want to pick up with you is something that was eventually brought to the IRG on February 12th, but has been a discussion at the Commission throughout, which was the idea of whether the prime minister or anyone from the federal government should engage with the protesters and attempt to bring this to a close through either some sort of negotiation, some engagement, some speaking. So the first thing I'll bring up on that point is, Mr. Clerk, it's PB.CAN.00001184 -- or it might be 1844, sorry. Ms. Telford, this is a text exchange on February 6th between you and Minister Mendicino, so it's early days. As I said, the theme of interaction, negotiation is something that came up. Can we scroll down, please, Mr. Clerk? Keep going, keep going, going, page 8, please. Okay. Here we go. So if we can blow that up, it's really hard to read, but you'll see a notation here: ""Lawyer, arbitrator, mediator offer suggested by Anne McLellan of a possible interlocutor. Again, I think it's a long shot for the reasons we discussed. Also, I noticed after we hung up that we didn’t even spend a moment on politics and readiness."" Okay. So that part that may not be all that relevant. But can you -- do you remember this text exchange, Ms. Telford?",30-209-29,209,29,27,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-211-07,"Look, I think over the course of like, from the beginning of the occupation, when it became an occupation, there were numerous people who were trying to suggest anything they could to try to find a way to assist, and I think that’s what Anne was doing here. And I've received -- and I believe it's part of the documents as well that you've received -- I received suggestions from numerous other people as well. MPs were raising names with us. There were suggested names of MPs from other parties who were coming forward wondering if they could help. There was a lot of people that were trying to find a way to figure out if an engagement could work, and no one was able to take it past that first thought. And so no one could figure out who they should talk to. There was no clear leadership on the other side. There was no clear understanding of what they would even be talking about. The police were already, as we were being informed through the Incident Response Groups, they were already engaging at a certain level and so it wasn’t clear what this engagement strategy would be, let alone if it could have any effect. And you know, I think there's a difference too between engagement and negotiation. And the prime minister and the Cabinet, the government, wasn’t prepared to negotiate public health measures that were rooted in science. I'm not -- I also am not sure, and I think a lot of people weren’t sure at the time that really, that that’s what this was all about. And so figuring out what the topic of the conversation could be let alone who it could be with that could have any effect on changing the circumstances, when no one could answer that question, really, these conversations couldn't -- didn’t move past the initial suggestion of ""I wonder if.""",30-211-09,211,9,7,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-212-12,"Okay. So at this point, this is part of the conversation. We're still in sort of early days of the protest, and I think what you're taking us to now is what's come to be known as the engagement proposal. And we've heard some evidence on that. And Mr. Clerk, you can take that one down please and pull up SSM.NSC.CAN00002958. So Ms. Telford, I think what you've just been referencing has been canvassed before the Commission a bit, and it's Mr. -- Deputy Minister Stewart's engagement proposal that he prepared with the assistance of Marcel Beaudin from the OPP PLT. And this is now we're the evening of February 11th. It's a text that Minister Mendicino sent to you saying: ""Hey there. We got some very last- minute and thin paper tonight on an engagement strategy from my deputy minister, apparently socialized it with several people including the Ontario government, not me."" I'll just scroll down and see the rest of the text, please. It says it's unclear whether PCO, RCMP, or Ontario supports this, but he's flagging this as a concern about information flow. And then he says at the bottom, ""Sorry, but had to let you know. Marco."" So can you tell us a bit from your perspective? We've heard Minister Mendicino's perspective on it, but what was your perspective receiving this text, and do you know why Minister Mendicino was essentially apologizing, saying, ""Sorry, I'm just letting you know about this""?",30-212-14,212,14,12,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-213-16,"When the IRGs began convening, just the day before, I believe, one of the things that was stressed at the first IRG or in and around the IRG really was just the need for appropriate information flow and for regular and constant information flow. And so I believe that’s what he's -- he's saying sorry for there is -- he's letting me know that there's this information that is now floating around that has already gone to some people and it had not kind of followed the usual channels, and I think he was sorry that it was the hour that it was, that we were all trying to grapple with what to do here. But I had also just received the paper previously from the clerk, I think, about an hour before, by the looks of this, and so I wouldn’t read too much into the story, and we were much more focused on the draft. And, ultimately, what was decided later that night after I talked with the Clerk and I then called the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister agreed to put it on -- with the suggestion that was coming from the Clerk, he agreed to put it on the agenda for the IRG the next day for discussion.",30-213-18,213,18,16,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And so, you know, while everyone, including the Prime Minister, was encouraging everyone to put every option the table, and its why this was put on the agenda, ultimately, there wasn’t anything further to pursue on this at that time.",30-214-15,214,15,13,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-214-23,"Okay. Thank you, Mr. Clerk, you can take that one down. So we’re going to skip a little ahead in the chronology again. The following day, February 13th, is obviously key. There’s the Incident Response Group meeting in the afternoon followed by the Cabinet meeting in the evening. The decision coming out of the IRG is to have the Cabinet meeting, and then the decision coming out of the Cabinet meeting is to have a First Ministers’ Meeting to consult on whether or not to invoke the Emergencies Act. Mr. Clerk, can you pull up SSM.NSC.CAN00002941? It’s Mr. Clow’s notes again. This time at page 22. So when Minister LeBlanc testified a few days ago, we went through some of the comments, the record of the readout of the First Ministers’ Meeting, and some of what was expressed by the provinces there. And these, I believe, are Mr. Clow’s notes of that same meeting, and I’m wondering whether we can through a bit of these. And Mr. Brodhead, maybe this is best directed at you, but -- or that you can fill in a bit of the context about what was being expressed during the First Ministers’ Meeting by these various premiers and whether or not, in your view, in coincided with what you’d been hearing up to then about solving the problem of the convoy.",30-214-25,214,25,23,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-215-17,"Sure, I’ll start and then my colleagues can add. I -- you know, I think it was quite consistent with what we had heard before, but I think it was a very robust conversation. You know, we had the ministers, Minister Lametti and, I believe, Minister Mendicino or LeBlanc, and the Prime Minister speak. Then, the Prime Minister went across the country in terms of making sure he heard from each of the provinces and territorial premiers. I think -- you know, we had known on where -- not specifically on the Emergencies Act, but we had known from conversations with Ontario what they were kind of feeling generally. We had heard from a lot of the provinces. So I think it was -- it was quite an interesting conversation. I think we did learn a lot. And just to use, you know, a couple of quick examples, you know, some of the issues around supply chain that Newfoundland and Nunavut brought up, and concern from the Premier in the Northwest Territories about a blockade, concerns from Premier Horgan about RCMP being stretched too thin as they were -- a contingent to support another part of the country. And it really kind of showed the national nature of it and the kind of variety of issues folks were facing. And even the folks who were, I would say, more concerned, such as the Premier of Alberta or the Premier of Saskatchewan, you know, even they had said things like, “Well, I won’t quibble with the use of the Emergencies Act but I’m worried about enflaming folks,” which was something we were concerned about, had talked about at IRGs, was a real cause of discussion. And same with Premier Mo who said, you know, “The six you’ve mentioned sounds reasonable, but I’m worried about enflaming.” So, you know -- and even, you know, Premier Legault talking about, your know, the Sûreté du Québec and -- you know, and the dynamic between the Sûreté and the RCMP and us having to kind of, you know, discuss where those boundaries were them in calls, Mr. Leblanc mentioned, after with Minister Labelle, I believe it was, really showed -- like it was a very meaty conversation, I found, and -- but not a -- not a -- not one where I think we were shocked by what we were hearing because of the outreach that happened in advance.",30-215-19,215,19,17,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

30-217-01,"I would just add that this was some -- I’m not sure there’s a Prime Minister in Canadian that has had as many First Ministers’ Meetings as this Prime Minister has because of the pandemic, and so they were such a regular occurrence and this group of premiers know each other quite well because of that. And while, you know, there are perhaps sometimes more pointed and more partisan statements made in public-facing environments, in these meetings that they have -- and I think you can see that it in the notes and in the descriptions of it -- they really -- they are thoughtful conversations. And they do come at things differently; there’s no doubt. They have different, you know, regional needs and were facing different things in different parts of the country. But, as Premier King, I can still remember saying -- you know, toward the end, he was one of the later speakers, as per the notes, and him saying to the Prime Minister, “I know you don’t take this lightly,” and this was a thoughtful conversation. And because they really were grappling with -- you know, even those who were concerned about the potential inflammation if the Emergencies Act were invoked, even those who were concerned about their specific regions, understood there was a broader national -- potential national need here, and that the Prime Minister had the authority, ultimately, and potentially -- and the need to do this. And so even those who were showing some reluctance from their kind of premier perspective of their particular province were showing an openness or a recognition, as Premier Kenney did in sort of saying, “I won’t quibble with you on whatever you have to do with the Emergencies Act, ultimately.” And I think that speaks to -- they’d had an FMM just a couple of weeks prior to this that was solely focused -- before all of this had started, as part of -- par for the course now during the pandemic, because we need to remember the time we were in, which was the height of Omicron. And so they’d actually had an FFM just -- I think it was January 10th where they were talking about the new mandates that the provinces were having to put into place, and we were looking to support them on that front. So this is a group that has navigated crisis for a couple of years together in many, if not most, of their cases.",30-217-03,217,3,1,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

There was then, I believe, a call with opposition leaders, and then at some point that afternoon, the Prime Minister received a Decision Note from the Clerk, and fairly shortly thereafter took the decision to invoke the Emergencies Act. One thing I wanted to ask, from your perspective, was any consideration given in any of this to holding a debate before parliament, not to decide, of course, but to engage in a debate over whether the Emergencies Act should be invoked?",30-218-30,218,30,28,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

But the decision to invoke on February 14th was made after a series of discussions and inputs, the FMM that morning being a critical one -- the opposition leader called “the critical one”.

I believe: ""After revocation what happens to frozen accounts?"" So that's a topic we've explored a bit with Finance: ""At what point do we withdraw based on what inputs?""

There were still a lot of situations, there were still many threads. And if I remember correctly, Ottawa was -- there may have been the beginning of action, but it wasn't done. So definitely at the IRGs and on staff calls and in other conversations we were beginning to ask ourselves, ""Okay, what -- how long is this needed?"" And it was always understood, and it was made clear by the Prime Minister this should only be in place as long as it's needed.

We are continuing to see a range of protest events and solidarity actions across the country, with ports of entry and legislatures the key targets. I want to underscore two key bottom lines off the top. First - as it relates to Ottawa and Ontario, there is an operational need to maintain access to these powers to ensure that we can finish what we started and prevent any retrenchment. Even for the next 2 [to] 3 weeks."" And then after that: ""It is important that we retain the ability to maintain the perimeter, restrict travel and ensure we can continue to choke off financial support and other assistance to the protesters in Ottawa.""

30-223-13,"Important to point out is that both for the invocation and the revocation the RCMP was one of many inputs.

30-223-19,"Okay. One thing I wanted to ask you as well about the revocation decision is there have been some suggestions that the motion to confirm the declaration of emergency had been passed through the House of Commons but was up for a vote in the Senate, and that part of the timing of revocation may have been due to -- some perhaps lack of confidence around whether the Senate would confirm the declaration.

30-223-27,"So quite the opposite, actually. And yes, I am aware of that suggestion, that perhaps there was an attempt to revoke before the Senate got to its vote. We actually wanted the Senate to move as quickly as possible, and I think it did too, but as it was reported to us, the Senate was delayed in convening partly because of the Ottawa, very significant continuing Ottawa demonstrations that were happening right on the Senate's doorstep. They did begin their debate at a certain point, but that was not considered when it came to revocation. Decisions around revocation was ""What's the situation? Is this Act still needed? Are these powers still needed?"" We would have liked the Senate to have its vote, but I will also say I have no reason to be believe that the Senate would not have endorsed it, and I do believe that -- I'm not sure about this, but I do believe that this Commission has seen evidence that the Chief of Staff to Senator Gold, the Government leader in the Senate, was doing vote-counting and they were quite comfortable that they were in a good place.",30-223-29,223,29,27,speaker_start,15 ---EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

I just want to start with the statement in the PMO Institutional Report, which indicates that PMO staff engaged with Premier Kenney’s Chief of Staff, Ms. Livingstone, on February 5th and 12th. I just want to confirm that during that time, the PMO did not discuss the possible use of the Emergencies Act during those engagements.

30-226-14,"Okay. Thank you. And with respect to the First Minister’s meeting, Mr. Brodhead, you were asked about your understanding of the various positions of Premiers at that meeting. I’d like the clerk to pull up SSM.NSC.CAN00000625. And these are some expanded notes prepared and produced by the Government of Canada describing that meeting. Once we have them up, I’ll ask the Clerk to please scroll down to page 3. Okay. So we can see here that there’s some further notes about the comments of Premier Kenney at this meeting. And I’ll just walk through some of these right now. He starts by describing the situation at Coutts and how it went from 1,000 trucks on a rolling protest to 900 going home, with 100 staying behind. And then down to a group of 40, which he described as a core group. Then you’ll see him describe the arrests at the border and indicate: “We believe the situation has been secured.” (As read) And further down there: “Have procured on market for equipment and have drivers in place. Unless an unexpected surprise, should open Coutts border crossing today.” And a little further down again: “Would be problematic to declare emergency today to take momentum of arrests last night. Declaration risks further radicalizing thousands of sympathizers in Alberta. Know you have a lot of serious issues to balance off, including in Ottawa, but I am suggesting this could create a net negative for Alberta. If we need to seize or compel people, we are prepared to use our own Emergencies Act.” (As read) So you would agree that it’s fair to say that the Premier’s position at this First Ministers Meeting was that invoking the federal Emergencies Act was neither wanted, not needed in Alberta; correct?",30-226-16,226,16,14,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

There's no legal basis for, as you've already ruled, to redact any document on the basis of parliamentary privilege. There is also the issue, as I've re-raised by email as well, the issue with the notes of this witness, the process that was used in dealing with that needs to be reassessed. These are important witnesses. I need rulings, and so does everyone here. The rulings on the redactions are so important. And for example, Ms. Jody Thomas testified and said that she supported the invocation of the Emergencies Act, but there is a note that we got after we fought for the one redaction we got that said Jody Thomas did not. And it was put up on the screen. There was notes taken. It had one section 39 redaction on it, so if that's a Cabinet document we can assume Cabinet knew about it, and it states that section 2, no violence, and they were trying to come up with a way how to make this work anyway.

Then if you would order the production of all relevant records with respect to where irrelevant is claimed, those records are then subject to the implied undertaking.

They allowed the truckers to set up shop next to the PMO and West Block and where tens of thousands of people live and now realize the problem they helped create. Unbelievable.""

So I’ll start by directing my questions to Mr. Clow, because these comments are attributed to him, but obviously the others can add in.

30-307-11,"Let’s see how we do. First of all, the Order in Council sets out terms of reference directing the Commissioner to examine the -- to the extent relevant, the impact, role, and sources of misinformation and disinformation including the use of social media. And by misinformation we understand that to mean unknowingly or unintentionally spreading false inaccurate or misleading information. And we understand disinformation to be deliberately and intentionally spreading false, inaccurate or misleading information. Ms. Telford, at any point during the convoy occupations and blockades did you become aware of any misinformation or disinformation that was affecting the situation?",30-307-13,307,13,11,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY BRIAN GOVER,MR. BRIAN GOVER,brian gover
30-307-25,"There was -- I became aware of a lot of both misinformation and disinformation over the course of the occupation and the blockades. To name just a few examples, even leading into the first weekend, one was that this was even solely a trucker protest. And let alone the fact that it was solely about federal vaccine mandates. It was quite clear from very early on and even leading into the first weekend, we knew from the Canadian Truckers Alliance as was mentioned earlier and also from data that we had that over 90 percent of truckers were vaccinated. We also knew that a lot of the mandates that were being talked about were ones that were actually responsibilities and put in place or imposed by provincial level governments or even other levels of governments or jurisdictions whether they be school boards or cities. And then of course there’s a lot of misinformation and disinformation around vaccines themselves. And then personally, in terms of our office, we dealt with a number of different instances. Our official photographer was drawn into a conspiracy theory, unfortunately, where he was being alleged to be out taking a picture of some hateful flags. And he at the time was actually in isolation with COVID himself. There was no chance he was doing that. We began trying to correct that. He began receiving death threats during that period. There was also a fake letter distributed amongst people within the occupation that was signed allegedly. It was not signed by us but it was signed using my name and the prime minister’s name and suggesting ways in which we might agree to some kind of -- I don’t even know what. But this fake letter was corrected and actually made international news. It was corrected on CNN at the time. And then I personally was actually asked to stay away for quite some time from the downtown core because there was a -- it started on Telegram and then moved onto other social media channels -- a story that was created that I was going to create a false flag operation and have a horse killed and then blame it on the occupiers.

So in BC, for example, it was definitely concerning that Alberta was clear but BC -- not concerning; it’s good that Alberta progress was made with additional resources, but BC was facing its own problems: There were arrests at the Pacific Highway, there was a military-style vehicle there when the convoy activity happened in BC. So part of the concern across the country was, was there enough resources across the board to handle all of the pop-ups that were happening, and we were seeing in increasing numbers that weekend.",30-311-19,311,19,17,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY BRIAN GOVER,MR.

It just meant we could move at a speed that the other institutions, the other parts of our apparatus don’t allow. And so I think the combination of that and all the external advice we were getting, I think it was -- agree that it was a very kind of methodical process, and I think the Prime Minister was very clear about how methodical it needed to be, both in the -- both before and after.

So this starts with section 31, which is titled Responsibilities of the Boards. And if we can keep scrolling down, we get to subsection (5), please. Oh, there we go. So the training of board members, and the Act provides that: ""The board shall ensure that its members undergo any training that the Solicitor General may provide or require."" Now, my understanding from your witness summary is that in fact the Solicitor General does not provide formal training, or has chosen not to.

But when I think of training I think of lesson plans, I think of course training standards, and I think of that. That is not the formal training that is under -- that is delivered currently to the Police Services Act. There is ongoing training on a number of different areas that may come up that the advisors are able to help support the Board or help support the Board to receive training in a number of different areas such as an example of a Board asking for training in harassment and discrimination, and biases.

And because it was during an event, you took the position that advisors were not provide this training in the middle of an incident? Do I understand correctly? ` MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL: Yes. So the context of this is we were a number of days into an ongoing incident in Ottawa and the Board approached the advisor and asked for training related to Board governance. The Ottawa Police Services Board is a very experienced Board. They’ve had significant orientation. They have significant experience and a large number of assets available to them. So the position that I took and the direction was in the middle of an incident is not the time to remove a Board from their role and their function of governance and set them down and to provide additional training on top of what they’ve received, and the policies that they’re governing themselves by. What I did ask was that the advisor asked for particular questions from the Board and specifically the executive director and then we would help facilitate those questions with the appropriate answers and assist them in the interpretation of the legislation, their roles and their functions and their responsibilities.",30-323-14,323,14,12,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

I note here that it says part of the rationale for not agreeing to provide training during the incident is that the OPSB had its own resources, significant experience through former Board members on City Council. Now, I just want to be clear on that. Surely you agree that the Board and the municipal council are separate and distinct entities? ` MR.

30-324-24,Okay. And they’re legally separate as a matter of law? ` MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL: They are legally separate as a matter of law.

So the other entities, former members -- they’re resources but they’re not resources that have themselves a statutory duty. ` MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL: So I'm not familiar with any case that the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled on. With respect to responsibilities of the delivery of adequate and effective policing, in the Act there’s actually three areas that I'm familiar with.

And as I understand it, and I think you've accepted that a key issue at that meeting was whether or not OPS was still providing adequate and effective policing, right?",30-338-28,338,28,26,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MS. EMILIE TAMAN,emilie taman

30-339-11,"And that’s a pretty big question for a police services board to be asking in a crisis, isn't it?",30-339-13,339,13,11,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MS. EMILIE TAMAN,emilie taman
30-339-14,"Yes, it is.",30-339-16,339,16,14,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL,kenneth weatherill
30-339-15,"Because it implies that they may be asking themselves whether they need to consider their options, maybe under section 9 of the Police Services Act, right?",30-339-17,339,17,15,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MS. EMILIE TAMAN,emilie taman
30-339-19,"That and the fact that they -- I think it's a responsible thing to do for a board to regularly ask the chief and ask themselves, are we, in fact, delivering adequate and effective policing? Are we satisfying our legislative responsibility in the Police Services Act?",30-339-21,339,21,19,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL,kenneth weatherill
30-339-24,"Right. I mean, that’s something that should be done regularly, but certainly, if that question is being asked in a crisis, it's not a routine question? It's being asked because there are concerns as to whether adequate and effective police services are being delivered at that time; wouldn't you agree with that?",30-339-26,339,26,24,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MS. EMILIE TAMAN,emilie taman
30-340-02,"Yes, I would agree that throughout the -- a major event, that it would be appropriate for a board to ask those questions of itself and of their chief.",30-340-04,340,4,2,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL,kenneth weatherill

30-340-07,That’s correct.,30-340-09,340,9,7,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL,kenneth weatherill
30-340-08,"But you've also said that the chief acknowledged his inability to address the demonstration in Ottawa while maintaining his ability to manage public safety in the city more broadly -- his inability to do that, right?",30-340-10,340,10,8,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MS. EMILIE TAMAN,emilie taman
30-340-12,"The chief set out that he did have the ability to provide, from my interpretation of what I heard in the board meeting and in review of the board summary from the advisor, that the chief did demonstrate verbally to the board how adequate and effective policing was being delivered throughout the city. He was asking for additional support with respect to the demonstration -- demonstrators in the demonstration area.",30-340-14,340,14,12,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL,kenneth weatherill
30-340-20,"Okay. So I just want to be clear though because in the summary of your evidence -- and it may well be that it's an error, so this is an opportunity to correct that -- but on the third page in the last paragraph, just after the footnote 4, it says: ""His understanding was that Chief Sloly had acknowledged his inability to address the demonstration in Ottawa while maintaining his ability to manage a public safety in the city more broadly."" Is that your understanding, or is that a mistake?",30-340-22,340,22,20,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MS. EMILIE TAMAN,emilie taman
30-341-04,That’s right. He's saying he needs help with the demonstration but he is able to maintain public safety in the rest of the city.,30-341-06,341,6,4,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL,kenneth weatherill
30-341-07,"Right, so -- but he can't do both? He can't deal with the demonstration and maintain public safety?",30-341-09,341,9,7,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MS. EMILIE TAMAN,emilie taman
30-341-10,That’s what he's informing the Board.,30-341-12,341,12,10,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL,kenneth weatherill

30-341-17,"So I guess what I'd like to understand is why it is that you didn’t feel that this was information that the deputy solicitor general should be briefed on, that you have a crisis in Ottawa, you have a board asking questions about the efficacy and adequacy of policing on February 5th. You either don’t have a direct question or you have an indication from the chief that there's a real problem in Ottawa. You didn’t think that was something that the deputy solicitor general should be briefed on?",30-341-19,341,19,17,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MS. EMILIE TAMAN,emilie taman
30-341-26,"So if we turn to section 9, and you mentioned it a just a little bit earlier -- if we turn to section 9(6), the municipal chief of police who is in the opinion of an emergency existing in the municipality may request that the commissioner have the Ontario Provincial Police give assistance. That had taken place. So there was a direct line between the Ottawa Police Service and the Chief to the Commissioner, and I was very much aware that there was support on the ground by the Ontario Provincial Police to support the demonstration and the dismantling of that demonstration at that time.",30-341-28,341,28,26,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL,kenneth weatherill
30-342-09,But there hadn't been a request for the OPP to come in and assume control of policing in Ottawa; right?,30-342-11,342,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MS. EMILIE TAMAN,emilie taman
30-342-12,That's correct.,30-342-14,342,14,12,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MR. KENNETH WEATHERILL,kenneth weatherill
30-342-13,"Right. And if the Board was asking those questions, would you agree that the reason in the context of a crisis to be asking that question is because they're asking themselves whether they might have a duty under the legislation to themselves go to the OPP and request that the service take over in Ottawa?",30-342-15,342,15,13,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MS. EMILIE TAMAN,emilie taman
30-342-19,"So there would be a number of necessary steps that would need to take place if the Board had lost confidence in their Chief, and if the Board were to reach out to the Commissioner and ask for policing services, then the Chief would need to be removed. And that did not happen. The Chief had made the request, the Board appeared to be satisfied with that request, and was aware that the OPP were there and supporting the Ottawa Police Service in formulating plans, along with seven other municipal services, and on the 5th of December, up to 257 RCMP officers.",30-342-21,342,21,19,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

30-343-04,"Okay. No, no, that's okay. And just finally, I just want to understand the timing of the request by the Board for training. How did that coincide with what you heard on February 5th? In other words, were they trying to figure out what it was that they were expected to do if they had concerns about adequate and effective policing? They're asking for training, they're asking for advice, and they're not getting that. Is that right?",30-343-06,343,6,4,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MS. EMILIE TAMAN,emilie taman
30-343-12,"No, I disagree with that. They were asking for governance training. That Board is quite experienced in governance. They wanted governance training in the middle of an incident, and that would have been irresponsible for my advisor to be there pulling a board away from their responsible duties of governance and oversight in managing the scenario from their perspective in their function and roles.",30-343-14,343,14,12,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

30-343-26,"I just had one point of clarification first, just for the record. My friend for Chief Sloly mentioned the dates of some of the Board meetings.

30-345-07,"Of course. So generally, if it was the Chief who was made aware of it, and if the Chief was confident that it was not the Board Chair, then they would have that conversation with the Board Chair and give the Chair an opportunity to share the appropriate policies with the broader Board and address the individual that may be that leak. If that does not resolve it, or if it's of such significant, serious significance, then the Board Chair can go directly to the Ontario Civilian Police Commission and ask them to conduct a review and a subsequent investigation into it -- the matter. If the Board Chair themselves are aware of it, then it's incumbent upon the Board to address their own policies, and if that does not correct the matter, then the Board, or if it's of significant severity that it would be inappropriate to do so, then the Board Chair would again then go directly to the Ontario Civilian Police Commission and request that they undertake a review and launch an investigation into misconduct of a, potential misconduct of a Board member.",30-345-09,345,9,7,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

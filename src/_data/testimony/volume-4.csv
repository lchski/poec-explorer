04-010-11,"Well, the information was not particularly clear. No one had a real sense of how many vehicles were coming, whether they were going to stay a long period of time, what their actual plan was. There was a sense on the -- the Chief indicated that the group was somewhat disorganized and did not speak with one voice.",04-010-13,10,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

04-010-20,"That they were coming from three different locations, the west, the east and central Canada to convene on or near Ottawa, and that they were upset with the mask mandates, which were primarily, as you know, a provincial matter, but they were upset with the federal government as well.",04-010-22,10,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

04-010-27,"My recollection was that they would be here for one or two days. That was the norm. You know, a lot of people protest in our city, and our police do a very good job of controlling and managing the situation. And to the best of my knowledge, we never had a protest in the 25 years I've been in public service that lasted more than a couple of days and then they gathered their signs and placards and went back home.",04-010-29,10,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MAYOR JIM WATSON,mayor jim watson
04-011-07,So it was -- one or two days was the sense that you got from the Chief in terms of how long the convoy would be in Ottawa?,04-011-09,11,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,natalia rodriguez
04-011-10,"Yeah, there was a bit of a moving agenda for the organisers of the convoy because at one point they had, I believe, Mr. Bernier wanting to speaking, and then he wasn't able to come on the Friday or the Saturday and there was push back a day. So there seemed to be some challenges that they were having as to who was going to speak and when they were going to speak and that prolonged it. My view at the time was that it would probably last a couple of days. My understanding was most of these truckers were independent and if they weren't on the road doing business and pickups they were losing money, so that they would in fact go home on Saturday or Sunday, and obviously that did not happen.",04-011-12,11,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MAYOR JIM WATSON,mayor jim watson
04-011-23,Right. And the Chief didn't give you any indication that it would be other -- anything other than the weekend?,04-011-25,11,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,natalia rodriguez
04-011-26,"No, we didn't have any indication. We had a memo or an email from Steve Ball at the Hotel Association indicating that one of the organisers had come and enquired about a long-term booking of thirty-plus days at a number of hotels. They wanted, I think, 9,000 to 10,000 hotel rooms.",04-011-28,11,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MAYOR JIM WATSON,mayor jim watson
04-012-04,And did that concern you at all?,04-012-06,12,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,natalia rodriguez
04-012-06,"Well, it did, except, you know, when you're making a booking you have to have some evidence you're going to follow through with it. So simply asking about booking 11,000 rooms when the city only has about 11,000 rooms at its disposal for tourism industry, I don't think most took it seriously for the simple reason that there was no follow up. It was simply asking about rooms and room availability, and rates I suppose, and then it didn't really anywhere because my understanding is that the bulk of the people with large rigs stayed in their cabs, they didn't need hotels.",04-012-08,12,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MAYOR JIM WATSON,mayor jim watson
04-012-16,"And so in your discussions with Chief Sloly on the 26th, was there any discussion about what would be done in the event that the protestors decided to stay longer than a couple of days?",04-012-18,12,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,natalia rodriguez
04-012-20,I don't recall any other discussion on that at that point.,04-012-22,12,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MAYOR JIM WATSON,mayor jim watson
04-012-22,"Okay. Now, at some point you began to use the term ""occupation"" in your correspondence. At what point did you determine that this was no longer a protest and that it was an occupation?",04-012-24,12,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,natalia rodriguez
04-012-26,"Well, a couple of points. First, when more people started to arrive; and secondly, when people were not leaving the Parliamentary Precinct. So there were those two points that really brought to light the fact that this was going to more of an occupation as opposed to a protest. As I said, the police in our city are very used to handling large protests, and large visits of state leaders and so on, but nothing of this magnitude has ever been seen, quite frankly, in any city that I'm aware of in Canada in the last 25 years.",04-012-28,12,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MAYOR JIM WATSON,mayor jim watson
04-013-08,"So is it fair to say by Monday, the 31st, after that first weekend, when the majority of the trucks were still there, that that's when you determined that they were not going to leave anytime soon?",04-013-10,13,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,natalia rodriguez
04-013-12,"Thereabouts, either -- whether it's the Monday or the Tuesday, and then certainly that was solidified in my mind that they weren't going to leave on the weekends. When the weekends started to create this very tense situation where people were coming in from all over the region, and in fact, different parts of the country to come and support the protestors, and that's where the havoc and the chaos was created in our communities.",04-013-14,13,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,natalia rodriguez
04-013-20,And was there ever a discussion that you had with either Chief Sloly or the deputy chiefs about blocking access to the additional convoys that were coming that second weekend to join the original protest?,04-013-22,13,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

04-013-27,"My bigger concern at that time, from recollection, was what can we do to ensure that the trucks don't go into the residential areas? Because we knew that the impact that would have. Because we'd seen in the first couple of days the constant horn honking, and they had some train whistles on some of the trucks, and there was just unruly behaviour on the part of these people who had come and basically occupied our downtown.",04-013-29,13,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

04-014-07,So it wasn't a concern that there were additional convoys that were coming to join to kind of expand the footprint of the original convoy?,04-014-09,14,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,natalia rodriguez
04-014-10,"Well, I think there was concern, absolutely, because when you saw hundreds and then it turned out thousands of people arriving with different pickups and 18-wheelers and so on, that this was going to be bigger than any of us had imagined.",04-014-12,14,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MAYOR JIM WATSON,mayor jim watson
04-014-15,Okay. But there wasn't a discussion to try and prevent that from happening?,04-014-17,14,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,natalia rodriguez

And as we know, these are summaries of the call, it's not a transcript, but it gives you a sense for what's being said. And if we go to -- right. So JW is when you're speaking, PM is when the Prime Minister is speaking. And so the second thing -- second section there before the redacted portion, the second sentence, third sentence, you said: ""These people had their time and need to move on.

04-015-28,"Well, I was interested in what the plan of action from the police was going to be in order to clear out the downtown core because my sense was that this was not shrinking in size, as people started to go back home, it was growing in size. So everyone could see that. And I -- you know, I stressed to the police -- as you know, we can't direct the police on what to do, but certainly in conversations I had with Chief Sloly, he understood very well the importance of getting this situation resolved sooner than later because it would grow into a bigger issue.",04-015-30,15,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

04-016-19,"No, I -- as I said, I can't direct the police, but certainly I asked the questions, you know, ""What is the game plan to move forward?"", and he -- the Chief said that they're working on one, and I relayed that to the Prime Minister. He -- the Prime Minister wanted to get a sense of what was going on on the ground, and how this was affecting our city, in particular, our residential community and the small business community. Because as you know, we just got out of a lockout from COVID, and restaurants and businesses could start opening, and then all of a sudden we have another lockdown imposed really by the occupiers who came here to disrupt our quality of life.",04-016-21,16,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

It was completely despicable behaviour on the part of these individuals. We welcome protestors who are respectful of the law and respectful of our communities. The vast majority of these people and that kind of behaviour were not being respectful, and I think were hurting their cause, quite frankly.

And so I was approached at some point in that time frame from the consulting firm that represented Go Fund Me in Canada, to see if I would be amenable to having a meeting with senior Go Fund Me people to discuss and to let them know that the funds they were collecting we're very much harming our city and in my opinion engaged in illegal activities. So the meeting was arranged and we had a number of people on the call. They had also spoken I believe earlier in the day, or after my call with, I think it was Chief Bell, so he gave them a more detailed situational report as to what was happening in our city, and why we felt that these funds should be frozen and ultimately sent back to the individuals, because those dollars were keeping the convoy going.",04-020-28,20,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

There’s a little bit of an urban myth or misconception about what a municipal state of emergency is. It has very little impact on public safety. It really is an administrative tool that allows the City, for instance, to bypass the procurement policy of the City of Ottawa. A good example is during the pandemic, I declared a State of Emergency and it allowed us to go and get personal protection equipment without going through a tender process of the top three and so on. So it made those kinds of decisions quicker, it allowed the City Manager to take people from one branch of the City in a different collective agreement and move them into another area. We needed people, for instance, to administer needles and do COVID-19 tests. And, you know, if you had a job that was not essential to that, we needed extra people. So I think it was, in some ways, to give some comfort to the public that, yes, we consider this an emergency, but we were constantly explaining and trying to allow people to understand that this really did not have any impact on the overall removal of individuals.",04-027-13,27,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

We don’t have all the powers that people think we do as Mayor, or as Council, and we need to show a united front, that all of us are legitimately concerned about the challenges facing our residential communities, our small business community, and we needed to move forward. So yes, it was frustrating that the Province was not as responsive. I can say though, in fairness, once they did get engaged, they were very good partners. The OPP was very helpful. But it was getting to that stage. And as I mentioned, I believe in our interview, the Solicitor General at the provincial level seemed to believe that there were 1,500 OPP officers on the ground, which was not true at all, and I checked with our police officials. I said, “How many OPP today?” And they said 50 to 55. So they -- the Solicitor General kept repeating that there were 1,500 police officers. You’d know if there were 1,500 OPP officers.

I checked earlier this week because I saw this email, I hadn't seen it before, but it never went to City Council, it was a draft. And I know that at some point in that period I had also suggested publicly would there be a role for the Federal Government to appoint a distinguished Canadian who could go in and mediate and resolve this. The idea was not supported at all by the Federal Government. I referenced it, I believe, in a CTV interview. But I don't think the two were connected, even though the subject is the same. I think Councillor Cloutier, to his credit, and Councillor Egli were trying to come up with some reasonable suggestion to try to bring and end to this. Because I think, if I can put it in context, every member of Council, whether you lived in the downtown core and represented it or not, were feeling overwhelmed and under siege by constituents and by people from across the country harassing members of Council. And I think all members of Council, to their credit, were trying to do their very best to come up with sensible ideas that they could present to us, including the Chief and the City Manager and myself and my office, to see if this would help resolve the situation. So all members of Council, in good faith, were trying to do what they thought was best. And in this particular case, I don't believe this motion, I know for a fact it didn't go to Council, so it was just a draft, and I suspect it probably didn't go to Council because the quick response I received from the Federal Government was ""We're not going to appoint a mediator.""",04-041-09,41,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

He provided us with his request, because Councillor Deans and I both agreed that we needed to get something in writing because it was putting us in an awkward situation where we were having these regular meetings with federal and provincial officials, and they said, ""Well, how many resources do you need?"", and we didn't have an answer. So to the credit of the Chief, he put together a very thorough -- it wasn't just police officers, there were obviously other components that he had asked for, including civilian staff and public order officers, cyber investigative capacity individuals and social media forensics and financial forensics.

And then you say: ""As of today, there are currently between 400 and 500 trucks occupying Ottawa's downtown core."" Then you go on to say: ""These acts and the occupation are having damaging and long-term impacts on the well-being of our residents. People are living in fear and are terrified - and they've now been subjected to the non-stop honking of large trucks for nine days, which is tantamount to psychological warfare."" Then you say: ""Given the scope and scale of the armada of large trucks that are now occupying our downtown core..."" And this is now on the second page: ""...we are writing to you to ask today for your help to secure 1800 officers to quell the insurrection that the Ottawa Police Service is not able to contain."" And then further down, you say: ""We must do everything in our power to take back the streets of Ottawa, and our parliamentary precinct, from the criminal activity and hooliganism that has transpired over the last nine days. We need your help to end this siege at the heart of our nation's capital and in our residential neighbourhoods and to regain control of our city.""

The residents living on those streets, having these horns honk literally 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, plus the diesel fumes, plus they're roasting a pig on one street, bonfires, lighting off fireworks, having a dance party, it was showing complete disrespect for the people who lived in the City of Ottawa. And I put that wording in very strongly to let the two other orders of government know that we needed their help. Our city's back was against the wall, we had this outrageous behaviour by people who seemed to have no respect for private property, public property, or the well-being of the citizens of Ottawa.

You know, in one or two incidents the Chief explained to me the police tried to stop them and then they were swarmed by a hundred truckers. And one of the things I think is vitally important to remember in this whole terrible situation was that while there was a high level of frustration on the part of the public, rightfully so, on the part of our Council and City Staff and myself, at the end of the day there were no deaths and there were no serious injuries. And so the Chief, in his wisdom, and I agree with him, was not going to barge in there without necessary resources to make sure that the one shot they had, the one opportunity they had to actually get in there and clean up Wellington Street and Kent and O'Connor and the Byward Market and the baseball stadium was to do it with the necessary resources to move in quick, swiftly, and that's exactly what they did, and I appreciate the police doing that. But you're quite right, on the red zone it was lawlessness. People were having parties, there were open fires, and they were firing off fireworks that were a fire hazard to heritage buildings in the downtown core. They were harassing people in restaurants, tearing off their masks. These are not sort of made-up stories, these are all documented during the convoy occupation. And so yes, we -- we're not swallowing our pride by saying we -- you know, we could do it on our own.

However, criminal behaviour is never tolerated, and hatred or intolerance must be condemned by all.” And she says, the last paragraph at the bottom: “We have been encouraging all those participating in the Ottawa protests to govern their actions in a way to ensure they are peaceful and respectful to the community and to those charged with keeping the peace.” And then she says: “Regarding […] request for significant additional […] resources, please note that I have shared your correspondence with [OPP] Commissioner Thomas Carrique.

And the whole issue, as I talked about earlier, the Solicitor General was under the impression that there were 1,500 officers assigned to Ottawa, which was not the case. I think what may have happened was that the Minister or the OPP were, you know, giving a cumulative number, you know, 50 here, and then maybe 40 came back, and then another 60 arrived, so you count 50 plus 60.

And I think certainly after Windsor, they recognized the next big problem is Ottawa and they better, you know, get there as soon as possible because this thing was close to swirling out of control. And what we were seeing was every weekend, people were treating this like it was some sort of a rave, or a party, or something, and arriving. And there were DJs, and loud sound systems, and racist flags, and desecration of our National War Monument, and I think -- you know, I can't give you the exact date, but eventually, the OPP came on board. Eventually, we got the RCMP. But as I said, this thing frustrated me because, you know, the public were saying, ""Well, why don't you tell the police to do this?"" And as we all know, or most people know, in our society, a politician cannot by law direct a police service on operational matters.

04-064-09,"Well, what I think we were trying to do was to keep that number confidential because we didn't want to show our hand, or the police’s hand as to how many resources were coming in. But I don't know when the 1,800 came out, it may have come out of the Police Services Board or a question from a Member of Council, you know, you couldn't keep it suppressed forever. But you know, I certainly was not concerned with protesters coming all the way from Windsor. What my preoccupation was to get the police officers that had quelled the situation in Windsor to get to Ottawa as quickly as possible. I think his point is it was a bit of a game of whack a mole. When they’d sort of resolve one situation another thing would flare up. A good example of that was the shack that was being built near the canal and the NAC in Confederation Park, this permanent structure where it was a food distribution point, and it was very, very, unsafe. There was propane, open fires, gasoline, all stored in this area, and our Fire Chief and fire service said this is a tinderbox that could explode. So you know, we had to request from the NCC, because it was their property, to move in. They eventually did move in and tore all of that down, but then people started to come back again. So it was one of these great frustrations that people had where you've got one thing resolved and then you moved on, you just didn't have the resources to keep enough police services there to ensure that a flare wouldn't happen again.

04-067-04,"Well, you know, there was a level -- we were a bit like the meat in the sandwich. We were trying to get both orders of government to provide their national and provincial police services to the City of Ottawa, and the numbers that the Chief and his command team required to get this issue resolved. And we knew, you know, if you go back and look at the sequence of events from week one, to week two, to week three, we started to see a lot more action on week two than we did in week one. And what was important I think from my perspective was, you know, we all had a skin in the game in the sense that we had a police force, the OPP is a provincial police force, and the Mounties are the federal police force. And we need it all to be working and following the same script, because the last thing we needed was a bunch of distractions where you know, they don't agree, and they are fighting and squabbling. You know, at the end of the whole process when the police finally did move in and they have the 1,800, I believe it went up to 1,900, it was in my opinion -- and I'm not a policing expert -- but a very good case study on how to resolve a situation relatively quickly. They moved in, I believe on the Friday, they had the notices attached to all the vehicles on Thursday, and most of the work was done on Saturday, and then the last of it cleaned up on Sunday. And so, my point was I can't go and start criticizing the province if you still haven't given me a commitment for the number of officers we needed from the RCMP. Now, to get back to my point on sequence, I understand, you know, I think a lot of public would say, well, why weren’t there more police here more quickly? We had police from Vancouver, Calgary, you know, all over the country, municipal forces, the Mounties had to ship people in from all parts of the country, and that takes time, there's logistics to that. That's why I wish that had started two weeks ago, at the end of week one instead of at the end of week two. But at the end of this process, there was a logistical challenge to get that number of officers, most of whom had to fly or drive to get to Ottawa. We had to put them up, this is an expensive undertaking, we had to make sure they had proper food, that had to be sworn in, those Mounties that were coming in, because they didn't have jurisdiction on municipal grounds as a Mountie, but the OPP did. So there were a lot of things that took time, so I wish I could have snapped my finger and said, let's have 1,800, get them in there and end this nonsense. But that was not the case because it took, you know, four, five, six days. When they finally ramped up and they had the 18 to 1,900 individuals it was a very good show of leadership, and a very good show of the professionalism of the police officers. And I repeat this, because I think this this gets lost, we'd be having a much different Commission and discussion if someone had been shot and killed or seriously injured. That did not happen, and that is good, I think, credit to the police officers on the ground in miserable conditions. As you recall, it was freezing, February, ice all over the place, and you know, they cleaned it out, and I give great credit to our first responders and others who worked very hard, paramedics, fire service, by law, public works, OC Transpo. It was all hands on deck. And I know the public wanted us to move faster, and I empathize with what they were going through, but at the end of the process I think we have to remember that there was not -- these things are tinderboxes, you see them in other jurisdictions where it flares up and you see the tragedy of, you know, unprofessionalism taking hold.",04-067-06,67,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

04-074-22,"Well, I think he was alluding to the fact that it would have been helpful to have the Province -- you know, it’s like a three-leg stool; if you only have two legs on it, it’s not that sturdy. You need all three; the provincial, municipal, and federal orders of government, number one. And I just think, you know, during a crisis, from a leadership point of view, the more information you have, the better to share with your partners. We’re not in opposition to one another, but we need all three to be singing from the same hymn book, as they say. So my interpretation of that on that call with the Prime Minister was that he felt that we needed to continue to put pressure on the OPP and the Province -- not the OPP, but the Province to get the OPP to come in good numbers, just as they did in Windsor. I think Windsor was wrapped up relatively quickly, and there was the situation in a small town in Alberta where there was a fairly large RCMP presence. We needed both of those police services on board in order to move in. The police from Ottawa cannot do it on their own, and having 50 OPP and another 50 or 100 RCMP was not going to cut it.

We did that, for instance, during the flooding, I believe, in 2017, 2019 where the military were very helpful to come in and help. But from my perspective, this was completely different. We weren’t -- this is not a regular, you know, situation; this is a very unique situation. And, again, I challenge anyone to come up with any time in our recent history in the last two generations where this kind of a -- you know, an occupation took place for a prolonged period of time. So, you know, I think he was referencing probably the normal course of events is that we would normally go through the OPP and up the chain of command.

So I can't recall where Chief Sloly and I were not on the same page. You know, most of the press conferences dealt with police matters, so he was the lead in it, and I would be scrummed, for instance, after a Council meeting of when we had a Zoom call of any nature. But I don't recall any rift that we had. I think one of the things was, you know, I was probably very impatient at how slow the process was going to get the police officers and how slow it took to get the actual breakdown as to what the Chief needed.

And I think almost every Canadian has that same questions. Why were these allowed to happen? And it's easy to be, you know, talking about hindsight and looking in the rear-view mirror. I think this thing came about, and it just kept growing and growing, and we collectively, all three orders of government and the police, did not respond quick enough, and we allowed that major street, and led into the residential streets, to be taken over by a group of people that had no respect for the law and no respect for the people of our city.",04-078-25,78,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

They wanted to have Wellington Street, a flat bed truck and a podium and a sound system to denounce the Federal Government. So if they couldn't have that, going onto Queen or Albert or Slater, not much of a backdrop on those streets.

If you go down to Wellington Street, there's still a corridor where an ambulance or a firetruck can get through. But you're quite correct, you know, the challenge we all faced was that this thing came, we didn't think it was going to be as big as it did. And I've had conversations with other mayors who said, ""you know what, we learned lessons from you."" You know, Toronto, I think handled the situation, and the mayor told me, Mayor Tory, that, you know, we were the guinea pig of these protests and it allowed them to get their act together at the start of the issue because they saw what -- the pattern of activity, the truckers were doing here in Ottawa. And as a result, they were able to secure tow trucks quickly and they were able to close off access points to Queens Park, and the same thing happened in Quebec City.

But ours was lingering on and there was -- you know, while we’d see -- you know, we’d have sort of a bit of an up and down where, you know, one day we’d get a count saying five or six of the rigs moved out, which was good, and then the next day we’d have, you know, seven or eight are coming back in. So it was very, very fluid and very frustrating, and I think, you know, I was expressing my frustration, as was the Prime Minister, that on two fronts, one, we need the pressure on the OPP -- or the Province to get the OPP here, but secondly, the Federal Government had to step up and do its duty, particularly being the Nation’s capital. We needed the RCMP. And, you know, as I said, I went through this period where you were spending an hour arguing that we don’t have 250 officers, you’ve already assigned 150 to those three.

It worked, because we got the police officers we needed. You know, you don’t necessarily want to go and constantly prod and attack and so on, but most of this was done behind the scenes so that we were not going to show, at least at the political level, there was this fractious debate.

And on the first page, Minister Mendicino talks about discussions with Commissioner Lucki of the RCMP to provide an additional 275 RCMP officers, and then he says: ""This will be operationalized in conjunction with the OPP, need to have a sense of the plan.""

If we have secure the number of OPP officers in that period time or a couple of days later, there was not much point in meeting again.

They were quite substantial. You know, when you walked through the site and you saw Belleville police cars, and York Region, and Toronto, it was actually quite a relief to see those other police officers helping their fellow police officers.

Well, it takes time to get the plane tickets and get over here and get hotel accommodations and so on.

We had certain responsibilities from bylaw and keeping the streets opened and municipal requirements and policies and permitting process. This was just -- this overwhelmed the City of Ottawa. It overwhelmed us at the administrative, bureaucratic, operational, and political levels. We had never seen anything like this in our lives, and I think we were all, quite frankly, treading water, trying to keep our head afloat as we saw this situation unfold in front of us, both on television and in person. So it was, you know, a horrific experience for the people who lived there, who tried to work there, who tried to visit our city. It's had long-lasting impacts on many people's health. It's hurt our tourism industry, for instance. And you know, we have to rebuild that trust with the public and with the police, and we have to, on a go-forward basis, learn lessons and hopefully the Commission's report will bring forward a series of recommendations that we -- if we ever have a situation like this, we'd do much better for the public.",04-097-25,97,25,23,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION BY MS.

In hindsight, you know, maybe we just declare it so it brings that peace of mind to the public that we know it's an emergency. We didn’t need a document to know that this was an extraordinary, dangerous, serious situation that was going to have negative impacts on our residents, and quite frankly, the country.

So we're very much a jurisdictional challenge because we have so many different layers of responsibility. But you know, if I was looking back and had the ability to you know, change what was done early on, I would have insisted that we have barricades blockading Wellington Street as a first step, because as I said, I think it was symbolic on the part of the truckers.

04-102-09,"The deal was to -- let me just backtrack for a moment. The reason why I went down this route was simply there was very little progress being made on any front to get the situation resolved. And my preoccupation number one was to bring some relief to the residential community. I wasn't as concerned about Parliament Hill or Wellington Street, even though those are important symbols in our country, but the people being affected the most were the people who were trying to get a good night's sleep and that were living in that red zone. And so I was approached, as you know, by Mr. French, who said he had contacts with trucking companies and those -- some of those that were involved. And he said, ""I'm willing at no charge. I'm not doing this for money or anything else. I'm trying to be helpful."" Because he was watching what everyone else was watching on television, this mess that was, you know, hurting so many different people and small businesses. So I'd met him two or three times. He was the former Chief of Staff to the Premier Ford. I'd had occasion to deal with him in my capacity as Mayor and he as Chief of Staff and was in two or three meetings with he and the Premier over a number of months. So I was a little skeptical. It was, you know, who does this guy know? You know, and I said, ""I'm not interested in meeting them, but, you know, if you can come broker some kind of a deal to get trucks out of the residential community, good for you."" So I referred him to my Chief of Staff, and I think Steve Kanellakos. And over a couple of days, they negotiated an agreement based on the letter that I sent to one of the organizers, Ms. Lich, indicating that I would be willing to meet with them on a number of conditions, and there are I think four different conditions. I think you have the letter. I don't want to give you the wrong conditions, but basically, you know, you got to get a number of trucks out of the residential area. They can't be replaced by other trucks. And if this is done and a couple of other things, then the Mayor would be pleased to meet with you. This stemmed from the fact that the Police Liaison Teams approached the City because there was concern that communication had broken down between the liaison teams from OPS and the protest leaders. And as you know, there was not one united voice that spoke for the protesters. There were many different leaders and different camps. So prior to Mr. French's call, Steve Kanellakos did meet with a number of the protesters in his office and heard them out. And when he told me they'd asked for a meeting, I was initially reluctant, not with me, but I said, ""I'm not sure if this is a good idea for Steve.""

And, you know, remain the status quo. So they met, and Steve Kanellakos reported back that they seemed to be serious in their attempt to try to bring the temperature down. And then I believe a day or two after, that's when Mr. French got involved. We sent a letter, Ms. Lich sent a reply back, agreeing to the conditions. And they started, I believe on the 13th or 12th to move the trucks. The letter I think was the 13th.

And so I was pleased that when Chief Bell, you know, oversaw the operation, we got sign off by the other police services, and the action that took place at -- on Wellington, Coventry, and Rideau, was quite remarkable at how quickly they moved it out and cleaned out the streets as fast as they did and as efficiently as they did, without losing a life.",04-116-18,116,18,16,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION BY MS.

And we have since submitted all of our costs. It's in the tens of millions of dollars, because as you know, particularly when the municipal police services arrive, they have to be put up in hotels, they have to be given three meals a day, there's expenses. And we reimburse all of those municipalities. I, for instance, ran into the mayor of Belleville a few weeks ago here in Ottawa -- a few months ago, rather, at the AMO Conference, and he thanked us for the quick repayment of the invoice that they received. So the premier was very specific and very generous, as was the prime minister, that they would be here to help us financially because the protestors were coming, not to protest the Corporation of the City of Ottawa, they were protesting mandates that were imposed by the provincial and federal government. We happened to be the -- as I said, the meat in the sandwich. We're caught in this middle fight between protestors and two other orders of government that are responsible for various mandates with respect to COVID 19.

04-154-20,"Okay. Now, can I just ask you quickly, then, a couple of other things about the news conference where Chief Sloly made the reference, I think it was February the 2nd, that, among other things, there may not be a policing solution to this problem. Did you understand, or do you now understand that what he was getting at was the very issue about resources; that the Ottawa Police Service on its own did not have the resources to deal with this as a matter of its own police service?",04-154-22,154,22,20,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

04-155-01,"Yeah, initially I didn’t understand that to be the case. I just thought he might be saying we need, you know, whether it’s a mediator or, you know, some other resource to solve this. And most people, I think, were under the impression -- they were scratching their head wondering, “Well, if it’s not going to be a police operation, what other kind of operation is there?” So I think, given time, that makes more sense when he says it’s not going to be a police operation, because he doesn’t have the resources. But, at the time, I was surprised that he’d said it that way and didn’t really elaborate or clarify what he meant.",04-155-03,155,3,1,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

04-155-21,"Absolutely, yeah. There’s no way -- I think any -- even a layperson like myself recognized that the Ottawa Police Service was outnumbered in terms of the resources they had. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, we have a whole city to police. We can’t take all of the police from rural Ottawa and suburban Ottawa; there’s still calls and activities that require police services.

04-161-13,"No, I wouldn’t equate that -- the lack of a plan with the request for boots on the ground. We needed both. We needed a plan, but we also knew that it was going to require a significant amount of time just simply to get these police officers from coast to coast to coast to arrive in Ottawa and get them set up and get them sworn in, if they were RCMP or municipal police services from other jurisdictions in Canada. So the two had to go in tandem, and I think as the previous lawyer talked about, the reality is that you -- we knew that we needed 1,800, and we had to be flexible enough to determine if we're only going to get 1,000, then the plan would have to change. So I think it was in flux, but there was no question from my briefings by Mr. Kanellakos that there was some argument in the command structure as to, you know, what the right plan was.

I know we'd been well served by Chief Bordeleau, but I think it was remarkable that we had, for the first time in our history, an African Canadian leader who had served the people of Toronto very well for over 30 years. And I was very supportive of his hiring. As you know, I didn’t sit on the Police Board at that time when he was hired, but when I was introduced to him when Councillor Deans brought him around before the announcement, I was impressed with his qualifications and his way of handling himself.

The same with the Federal Minister Blair. I think Mr. Blair knew Chief Sloly, obviously, as the former Chief of Toronto Police himself, and he, like others, at the political level, those confidential meetings was expressing concern that the plan was not coming together as quickly as possible. And I was putting pressure on everyone to get moving on this, because on the one hand, I was being asked with the support of Councillor Deans to send the letter that we've shown the public today to the premier and the prime minister. And my obsession, really, was to get the commitment by those two orders of government to get more police officers because we knew full well with our contingent of OPS, we could not do the job that the public expected us to do, and that was to clean up what was a horrific experience for your clients and our citizens.",04-165-04,165,4,2,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

With respect to the specifics of those meetings, there was nothing really that set off any kind of an alarm, from my perspective, that Chief Sloly was not capable and competent of putting together a plan and overseeing it. With respect to internal divisions, that’s something you can ask Councillor Deans, as she is the Chair, but I don’t have any inside or outside knowledge of what was going on behind the scenes with that command team that were putting the plan together. I can speculate that obviously, once Chief Sloly left the OPS, it was literally a matter of, I believe, two days and the police action started. So one has to assume that the plan that he put in place, by and large, was the plan, and there may have been some tweaking by the new Interim Chief Bell, but I certainly give credit to Chief Sloly for bringing it to that stage, and Chief Bell deserves great credit for bringing it to the actual point where the police officers moved in swiftly, carefully, and succinctly to bring an end to what was a miserable experience for the residents and small businesses of both Centertown, Downtown, as well as the Byward Market ---",04-166-05,166,5,3,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

Something went wrong where they stopped talked, so this group went in to see Mr. Kanellakos, and then two days later, we had the Dean French issue. So the police were involved, and both Chief Sloly and Deputy Chief Bell were aware that we had this call from Mr. French. And ultimately, they signed off on it. I think Chief Sloly wanted to make one change to the letter, but unfortunately, the letter had already gone out.

04-175-09,"No, I wouldn't use those words. I think it's a lot more challenging and lot more pressure filled. You know, when you take into account what this Council has had to deal with, and forget just the Council, the public. There were two tornadoes, there was a flood, there was the massive storm derecho -- I can't remember the name of it. There was COVID-19 that was with us for 2-and-a-half years, and there was the truck convoy occupation. So all of my colleagues and Council, myself included, were feeling the pressure of a very challenging time in the history of our city. You know, as I mentioned earlier, I was asked by some students that I spoke to at I believe Algonquin College the other day last week. They said, ""What was the most stressful time as mayor this term?"" And I think a lot of them were going to say, you know, the truck convoy. And I said, ""Well, actually, not to diminish the truck convoy, but it was COVID. Eight hundred (800) people died as a result of COVID, thousands more were seriously impacted, people lost their jobs, their livelihood, and that was a project that or a challenge that every single citizen of the world had to face. The truck convoy was a terrible experience, but it was for a set period of time, three weeks. It affected dramatically the people in the inner core, but it ended. We're still dealing with COVID and we're still losing people every day. So from my perspective, I think that added a tremendous stress because people were calling and upset with vaccination policies and mask mandates and everything else, and all of that came to a boil, obviously, when we had to deal with the storm and then with the convoy.",04-175-11,175,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

Mayor Watson, do you think you did that, you served your city by getting over political rivalries by bringing all city councillors together, whether it was Ms. Deans or Ms. McKenney or others whom you had disagreements, to lead the city through this unprecedented time?",04-176-13,176,13,11,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

04-176-21,"Well, I think it was -- you know, it was Churchill I believe that once said, you know, parliament in his case was not a tea party. You know, people come to these seats after a hard-fought election, they have strong emotions, they have strong opinions on different issues, and there's often clashes. That's the joy, I suppose, of democracy, where you don't have everyone agreeing all the time with everyone else. What our Council went through was horrific. What I tried to do was to provide as much information, do as much work as I could do with the federal and provincial contacts that I had made over the course of my public service career to bring realistic solutions to the problem so that we could give the city back to the people of Ottawa. And ultimately, we did do that. It was not a error-free, problem-free situation, and even Council voted that we apologise to the public, which we did. Because we let down an awful lot of people in Ottawa with a situation that we had never seen before and there was no roadmap to guide us. And given the fact that no one lost their lives, no one was seriously injured, people were affected, but the police, I believe, should be commended. And secondly, I think the Prime Minister did the right thing by bringing in the Emergencies Act because that solved our problem. It's easy to sit back and be a Monday morning quarterback, but the people who were suffering the most were the people of Ottawa, not the people of the West Coast or the East Coast. And so I thanked those colleagues, all colleagues, particular the two that were affected the most, Ms. -- Catherine McKenney and Mathieu Fleury. But all members of Council were feeling the pressure because they were getting emails from around the world, you know, with some pretty vulgar foul language and lots of threats against individuals, myself included.",04-176-23,176,23,21,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

04-196-11,"Yes, granted the magnitude of protesters and occupiers was significantly larger in Ottawa than it was in Coutts or in Windsor, so I think we had a much more difficult situation. If you just saw aerial shots or drone shots of the crowds around Parliament Hill and the ByWard Market and the Cenotaph and so on, it was significantly larger than -- you know, I -- looked like -- you know, in Coutts, there might have been, you know, 50 vehicles. Now for a small town and a small crossing, that's a big deal. I'm not diminishing that, but certainly just in sheer volume. And I think if I could just comment on this, I think what Councillor McKenney's motion was trying to get at was that there was a level of frustration that Ottawa Police were on Wellington Street trying to keep the peace and deal with issues of jerry cans coming and so on. And it then stretched our officers and didn't give them the ability to go in and patrol the residential neighbourhoods, which was Councillor McKenney's true -- you know, Councillor McKenney's desire to represent her constituents and protect those constituents, similar to Councillor Fleury. We had, you know, the tail end of the Parliamentary Precinct is in his riding by just the other side of the Cenotaph. So, you know, I think it was an attempt at the motion to ensure that we had some ability to have the Mounties come in and take jurisdiction on Wellington, and then -- Wellington Street, and then it would free up those Ottawa police officers to go deeper into the community neighbourhood. So the Chief came back and obviously pointed out that this was not legally possible to do. And then there was the other issue that we really haven't talked about, I think we talked about -- one other of the lawyers asked me about was the issue of what do we do with Wellington Street on a go-forward basis in terms of access and so on. So that's one discussion, and this is another discussion.

And it's fine for someone out, you know, West or down East to say, ""Well, you know, it was overkill."" No, we needed that Act. We needed to give our police resources the tools they could use, such as tow trucks, and so on, to actually solve the problem or this thing would've gone on for many, many more days, if not weeks.

And you also said at one point the feds needed to do their duty, and that was with respect to policing. How do you see the federal role? Do they have an equal obligation, in your view, for the policing with the province, they're equally responsible, or do you see it differently? I'm just trying to understand, let's just say, because you were in the province before and you're now with the City.

04-209-19,"I think that’s a good point, Commissioner, in the sense that Ottawa -- I'm not trying to be a braggart about Ottawa; I love the city I live in -- but we are a little different than most other cities because we're the Nation's Capital in addition to being a municipal entity under the Municipal Act of the Province of Ontario. And we have a large presence of government buildings and significant important buildings, whether it's the Supreme Court or the Parliament Buildings. And there is -- the mandate objectors were primarily focusing on, as I understand it, the federal mandate to cross borders and wear masks in planes, and so on. And we were caught a little bit in the middle, so I was equally frustrated by both orders of government, and I ended up, as you saw during the number of meetings and Zoom calls and so on, my constant prodding to get them to take this situation to a more urgent level. And so well, if we were another city that didn’t have the large federal government presence, everything from the National Cenotaph to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to the Ambassador core, I think your point would be well, you're no different than a regular city under the Municipal Act. I think we have that special responsibility as the Nation's Capital to ensure that when people come here, they come here feeling safe and secure and proud of their Nation's Capital. And I just wanted to get across to both orders of government that we could not do this on our own. We were -- literally, our back was against the wall. It was a very frustrating experience. But -- you know, and I've been critical of both orders of government, but I do have to say, if you allow me, I appreciate -- yesterday, I was with the prime minister and the premier at an announcement, and the premier was asked if he supported the Emergencies Act, and he said he'd sit shoulder to shoulder with the prime minister. There was that unanimity, myself as mayor, the premier, and the prime minister. All were at wits' end as to how to end this peacefully without any harm to citizens or protestors. And the end result, notwithstanding a very miserable experience for people who lived here during that three weeks of hell, the police did an excellent job getting the situation resolved.

04-211-08,"Yes. Yes, for the -- for a number of reasons, but I think it was a joint responsibility because we needed all hands on deck and we went farther than just the provincial police and the federal police.

04-212-19,"Thank you, Mr. Commissioner. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is John Mather. I’m one of the Commission counsel. As the Commissioner indicated, we are now going to enter into evidence a number of documents, and this is something that we expect that Commission counsel will do every week. To provide some context to the public, the Commission has received more than 60,000 documents as part of its investigative process. Commission counsel have identified, and continue to identify, documents that are relevant to the Commission’s mandate. Many of these documents will be entered into evidence as you’ve already seen through the examination of witnesses. They may also be entered into evidence through reports that are filed by the Commission or by institutions that have an interest in the Commission’s proceedings. Given the Commission’s timelines, however, we are not able to introduce and material documents in these manners, and some of these documents, then, will just be entered through this process. These are documents such as affidavits the Commission has received, meeting minutes, situational reports, other standard records and correspondence. On a weekly basis, Commission counsel advised the parties about the documents that they intend to admit into evidence the next week. These are documents that the Commissioner may refer to or rely on his final report and, for this reason, the parties are given an opportunity to object to the admission of any of the documents before they are admitted. Today, we are entering the first batch of these documents. There are 447 documents in total. They include, by way of example, City Bylaws for the City of Ottawa, City Council Motions, Minutes of the City of Ottawa and the Ottawa Police Services Board, and Letters of Request for Assistance relating to the City. As noted, these are documents that the parties have had the opportunity to review and advise whether or not they have an objection and we are admitting those documents over which there was no objection. These documents will be posted to the Commission’s website in the coming days and again, as I noted, this will become a regular part of these proceedings.

04-218-06,"So in Ottawa, we work under an Incident Management System, which is document also recognized by the Province of Ontario with regards to any type of incident or any type of event that we’d participate in. Through that system, we identify incident commanders or agencies that have jurisdiction and agencies that play support roles. And in this particular case, as it was a protest or demonstration, it fell under the authority, the sole authority, quite frankly, of the Ottawa Police Service and we were playing a support role. So we would assist, or we would attend and do By-law enforcement; however, we would always report to police with regards to what we were seeing and if there were any potential threats towards our officers with regards to, you know, violence or anything of that nature, then we would certainly back off and ask for police support to go in. So initially, that was the mode of operation. We would report to police, and we would allow By-law officers to issue tickets. Our primary purpose was to maintain the emergency routes on the first weekend to ensure that vehicles -- the emergency vehicles such as firetrucks and paramedic vehicles, et cetera, police vehicles can actually make their way around the city as all of those things were preplanned prior to the demonstration to look at every risk and every building, to identify how we would respond should there be an incident at any one particular building.",04-218-08,218,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

04-220-20,"Yes. What we mean by By-law acting as it normally would, again, as a support function to the police. It's tantamount to if we have a major house fire, fire is in charge, and they're incident command, and then the police come up, and they don't tell police what to do, but the police support the fire operation. Actually, a better example would be if there was a shooting and there was a victim inside of the house and our paramedic service was to respond, they wouldn't just run into the house after the victim without first clearing with police who are in charge of the incident because of the severity of it, clearing with them that it's safe for them to go in and do so and actually take care of the patient. So there are agencies that have jurisdiction based on the severity or the incident they're dealing with. And in this particular case, a protest was a police jurisdiction, so we would take -- By-law would not report to police, but they would certainly take their direction from police if required because the police were the agency having jurisdiction.",04-220-22,220,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

But with regards to enforcement of the fire code and open air burning, it was the exact same thing; we would either receive a complaint through 311 or -- and we would advise the NCRCC and they would say, you know, we know we have a fire. They go, yeah, we know it is -- we know there’s a fire there and the police would actually make the decision, do we go in or don’t we go in? Some of it was based on their resources, others was placed on the criminal element that was holding the fire, but for the most part the fire took -- not their authority, but certainly direction from the police with regards to it.

So I think the protestors got the message early on that we were going to have zero tolerance in the emergency routes for the protection of the citizens and themselves, and the buildings of the City of Ottawa. And but secondly, is the larger vehicle towing was the real challenge for obtaining those tow services. And so we reached out -- well, the EOC again reached out looking for resources. We were getting it from all different directions. The police asked the EOC to see if they can make some contacts. The police were also making contact with various tow companies. They were asking if we had any contact with the province, so through the EOC again, we were contacting the province to see if they had resources. The mayor suggested that, you know, Mayor Tory in Toronto had contacts. We did receive those from the mayor. And again, we would inquire with regards to the availability of towing. And for the most part, it was no, they didn’t want to participate, and initially, they were sympathizers, for the most part. The other thing was that it was their client group, and you know, their reputational risk down the road with regards to losing those clients. I didn’t hear damage to trucks much, but then they came out and said it was a driver safety issue, and that’s what they kept bringing forward all the time following, you know, other discussions with them.

04-277-14,"Certainly. Basically, there was an alarm for a water leak, or a sprinkler head had been knocked off, and so it was an alarm call for the fire service. We -- the fire service responded with four different trucks from different directions from different fire stations, which is normal from a deployment of our resources' perspective. We don't respond with just one truck. We respond with multiple, especially for a high-risk setting like a hotel. On arrival, one of the trucks, you know, got close enough but didn't get very close and that's what was observed by the hotel. And they thought, oh my god, if there's an emergency, you know, they can't get in here. The reality is, there was three other trucks responding. People were -- the responders were already in the hotel dealing with the incident. There was no delay in the response. So, you know, this was a heightened -- a time where people were very aware of all kinds of different issues, and it was being raised through us through the BIAs and Hotel Association that these types of concerns needed to be addressed because of public safety, their liability insurance, et cetera. So while I understand their fear, the risk of this call was very low, and we had preplanned that facility daily, and we've had conversations with the manager since. So really, from a risk perspective, it was a relatively low-risk event, but it did highlight that, you know, if there was a fire, you know, we may not get all four trucks there immediately and there would be some need for movement of the protest vehicles. So while it was an incident that was looked at, it wasn't deemed as high risk as it was being first explained to us.",04-277-16,277,16,14,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. ALYSSA TOMKINS,MR.

04-278-27,"Yes, can you just go up a bit, so I can see where that's from, from Jennifer Therkelsen. Okay. Now you can go back down. So in this particular case, you know, it's a private property, so they could request that By-law come and remove the illegal vehicles. It was a truck, a construction type truck that had a legal diesel container in it. So the fear of it -- you know, as Councillor Fleury indicated last week, you know, we should have evacuated the Rideau Centre. Well, that's not accurate because the risk was still very low. So in this particular case, the police attended initially, looked at the truck, spoke to the owner, told him he'd have to move it or he'd be getting a ticket. By-law eventually went out and gave them a ticket. Rideau Centre wanted it removed. It was one of those times when getting a tow for a small vehicle was more difficult, more challenging for us. And as a result of that, it took some time for us to secure the tow vehicle to come and actually remove it from the Rideau Centre. And when it finally -- when the tow truck was finally on route, the owner moved it himself. So the Rideau Centre was frustrated that it took, you know, a day-and-a-half to actually deal with this issue. But again, when we're dealing with the whole protest, we're looking at risk and we're looking at risk-based responses as well. So, yes, there are -- you know, the Councillor was concerned about the amount of layers with regards to us having to get the police involved, and the police coming back, and then police saying they can't escort By-law because they don't have the resources. And I could understand that frustration, and I could understand the Rideau Centre's frustration. They have valid concerns.

04-280-09,"Yeah, so -- yes, certainly. I went down to Wellington just to see, you know, how much trucks had been moved, and I noticed that they hadn't just been moved, but they'd been placed in a row where they can park a lot more of the trucks. And I think that they were doing that to try and get as much -- as many of the trucks on Wellington as possible. And so there was still quite a bit of room from, you know, Wellington from, let's say, Kent Street right down to West JAM with regards to, you know, the ability to park more trucks. Metcalf was cleared for the most part. Again, there may have been a few stragglers here and there, you know, south of Laurier, but Kent was still packed. So when Councillor McKenney was walking down Kent Street, she was right. There was no movement of any trucks on Kent Street. In fact, Kent didn't clear out until the police started their action to actually with the public order teams to move out, and then the trucks moved out quite quickly. And, but, yeah, so my walk was to just -- I’d try and identify, has any progress been made; is there still room; and are the protestors actually moving out as well or are they just trying to move everything to Wellington Street? And it was my perception, I guess, that I didn’t see a lot of trucks leaving town. I just saw a lot trying to get on Wellington St. And again, I can’t speak for Officer Drummond and the reasons for stopping it but I suspect that it might have something to do with that as well and the negotiation and the ability of both sides to be able to -- you know, the give and take factor, so.",04-280-11,280,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And then if it is fire, other rigs would be coming in and they would continue come in. So that’s the general-alarm assignment. Having -- if it was a fire, if the information came in that we actually have in fire in one of the rooms, there would have been several more vehicles responding because it’s a high risk.

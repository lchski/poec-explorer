She’s normally the gatekeeper because I tend to take too many cases. And Ms. Chipiuk, who I’d practiced law with in the past on other cases, approached me and asked me if I’d be willing to take a case at the Justice Centre. They needed senior litigation counsel. I agreed.

And I thought I really want to keep an -- this is prior to February 1st, of course, and I thought, “Well, I really want to keep an eye on this,” and I realized probably the easiest way to do that would be to make a nominal donation and then I would get the email updates, so I donated $15.

Obviously, I had grave concerns about the government’s policies and the harm that I’d witnessed in my own family with our children, with my neighbours, with my friends, with my colleagues. So, in that context, I have a very strong view that I think tremendous mistakes were made at a policy level.

15-012-22,"My instructions were to work with the leadership group to provide on-the-ground legal support. One of the things that we thought we would likely be doing, which we didn’t end up having to do, was to obtain an injunction. We anticipated that we would have to defend injunctions, provide legal advice as to the types of activities that they’re allowed to do and the things they’re not allowed to do. Also, it was clear at that time if you recall -- I apologize if I'm talking too fast again, sir -- if you recall that around that time, GoFundMe had publicly announced the suspension of the fundraising campaign. I was also told at the time of being engaged that work was underway to set up a not- for-profit corporation, Canada Corp., to ensure a proper organizational structure for the administration of the donations. Something else that I have done in my background that proved to be extremely useful, not only in Ottawa but in the event since, is I've represented not-for-profit groups and I've represented various industry organizations, so I've dealt with conflicts and strong personalities on boards of directors and seen the interpersonal quarrels that can arise, and some of the groups that I've represented have been comprised of independent ranchers, and upon arriving in Ottawa, I immediately realized this person had similarities between independent Alberta ranchers and independent truckers.

As we were boarding the plane, whoever was supposedly going to be paying for this charter turned out they weren’t going to pay for the charter, and the justice centre made the decision to send us anyway, and if necessary, they would pay for the charter if whoever was going -- who had originally said they were going to pay for it didn’t.",15-014-15,14,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And she didn’t feel comfortable being exposed to a long format press conference where every media person could come at her, basically.

The next day, I'm now starting to interact more, and I'm now in a big boardroom and there's these different people coming and going, and I'm trying to figure out who's who. You know, there was no organization chart or introduction session. It's not even like a meeting where you go around the table and introduce one another. That didn't happen. It was constant chaos. So I learned that there was a group and then I learned there was this TBOF. I didn't even know what TBOF meant initially. And then I'd heard about this Canada Unity, and then there was Mr. Bourgault's group, something for Freedom, and there was Veterans for Freedom. I could go on. There was so many different groups I was starting to learn of. And what I observed was that the different groups were trying to take certain -- trying to take control. And what I observed and believed to be true is that some were trying to take control because they saw the organic flat hierarchy largely of the convoy and wanted to make it more successful and felt they had the organizational capability to do that. Other groups seemed to want to reshape the Freedom Convoy into their own event, branded theirs, and I got the distinct impression from some other that they were trying to get their hands on what, at that point, was $10 million in donations. And my impression and my recollection from the discussions that I would have with Ms. Lich as various people would demand private meetings, or, you know, play games and say we weren't allowed to use the boardroom because it was their boardroom, those sorts of things, that she was under pressure from a lot of these different groups for the reasons I've given.",15-026-22,26,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

15-040-10,"Yeah, he’d given us a list of three -- so I led by saying once Eva and I went into the room -- and I know there was some conflicting testimony. There was three PLTs in that room. There was seven people in that room. I know someone testified. I think it was one of the -- it might have been Drummond -- that there was no police in the room. That is absolutely false. And he likely just wasn’t accurately briefed, I suspect. And I led by saying, “Okay, give us your top three. If we can get movement at three locations in the downtown -- if we can move trucks and protesters, where can we provide the most immediate and effective relief?” And they gave us the three locations and one of them was Kent and I can’t recall the other two. But what I also picked up on, as did Tom Marazzo and Eva Chipiuk, is that they spent almost the entirety of their time talking about Rideau and Sussex. And so even though we had this list it was clear to me and to us as a team that Rideau and Sussex was in a category by itself. So we promised them at the end of the meeting that we would keep the meeting secret. And the reason that that was important is in these situations it’s always about building trust and it’s the littlest things you can control that build the trust. And so we agreed to keep the meeting secret. And in fact no word got out about the meeting. And I said -- and I'm not from Ottawa so, you know, I was stuck in buildings and then when I was on the move it was often at night so I was very spatially disoriented all the time. And so I said to Eva Chipiuk who had done her -- I don’t think it was her Master of Laws; I think it was her undergrad or her LLB here in Ottawa so she was very familiar with the area, and om obviously was. So I said, “Can you please take me to Rideau and Sussex?”",15-040-12,40,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. JEFFREY LEON,MR. KEITH WILSON,keith wilson

15-042-03,"Yeah. We decided -- and this is the way things worked, particularly with the people that were there involved in the protest, is if something needed to be done you did it right there and then. You never waited. So the decision -- we had a discussion and it was Eva and Tom were like, well, why don’t we try and move this intersection right now? So I said, “All right. I’ll go back to the Sheridan.” And the reason that we agreed that I would go is because we had so little to negotiate with in terms of tools and tactics with the protesters. Because I had been on the stage at the press conference the week previous, I was recognized as the truckers’ convoy lawyer. So the idea was that if they made significant progress but needed just something more to get the truckers to agree to clear this intersection that I would -- that they would say, “Well, we’re going to have to have Keith come.” And then I would come and try and use whatever influence I may have. So that was the plan. And to be clear -- because there’s been conflicting evidence about this -- our focus at this intersection was to clear it, which is very different from the dal with the mayor what the objective was.",15-042-05,42,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

There’s the very high end condo tower. There’s the U.S. embassy down the road. The Senate. And on and on. And we were like, “Okay, we understand why they want this cleared.” So our goal was at least to clear up the west bound lanes.",15-042-28,42,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

15-043-06,"And if we can bring up -- back up your witness summary, WTS00000058 at page 7? And can you scroll up a bit? You set out there -- and in the interest of time I'm not going to take you through it all -- of what happened at Rideau and Sussex that led up to your finding out that there was a willing -- or at least Ms. Chipiuk and Mr. Marazzo at the bottom paragraph -- finding out that the truckers had agreed to move their vehicles to Wellington but there was a problem in removing the jersey barriers and that fell through.",15-043-08,43,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. JEFFREY LEON,MR. JEFFREY LEON,jeffrey leon
15-043-16,"Correct. It was not -- what had happened was my briefing is that we had an advantage because the first three big trucks that would have to move were the ones that had the Polish immigrants. And Ms. Chipiuk is Polish background and can speak Polish fluently. And she very quickly developed a rapport with these truckers. And we knew if we could get the first three to go it would incentivize the other ones to join in. There was a sense of each of these areas that people didn’t want to be left alone, that there was a real group think going, we picked up. So but this was an intense group. There’s no doubt about it. I mean, you've heard about that. There was this -- the first time I heard it was in this Inquiry so it was never on our radar. But so Mr. Marazzo gathered about 80 of them together and in the middle of the intersection surrounded by their vehicles, and got them to pick amongst themselves two representatives. And he moved forward in effectively a parlay in a military sense with the police to the west up closer to Wellington. And then the particular police liaison, Sgt. Fung Li, had a little bit of an aggressive personality. He could really turn aggressive very quickly. And Mr. Marazzo was concerned about him interacting directly with the trucker leaders from the intersection. So Tom went up and spoke to Fung and said, “Okay, bring in the equipment. We’re ready to move at least half the intersection, the westbound, up into that space on Wellington.” Fung Li’s phone rang. He stepped back. And then turned around and said to Tom, “The deal’s off. They’re not going to move the barricades.” And we now know from the record and the testimony of others that others higher up the command vetoed that movement. So Tom ---",15-043-18,43,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. JEFFREY LEON,MR. KEITH WILSON,keith wilson

15-044-21,"But this is important. Tom did not go back and disclose what actually happened. He said, “They just can’t get the barriers moved,” because he didn’t ant to destroy what little progress we had made. We agreed to have a cooling off because a lot of the truckers were upset. They had had arrangements to make the kinds of moves before our involvement and they felt that the police had double-crossed them. And so we decided to give everything a colling off and to try again on the Thursday.",15-044-23,44,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. JEFFREY LEON,MR. KEITH WILSON,keith wilson
15-045-02,And so that was on February 8th. And I take it that February 9th there were some discussions with the OPS PLT officers and that led to February 10th where you returned to Rideau and Sussex to try again. Is that correct?,15-045-04,45,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. JEFFREY LEON,MR. JEFFREY LEON,jeffrey leon
15-045-06,"On the 9th, the PLTs about 4:45, 4:40 p.m. contacted me through Eva Chipiuk. That was -- the protocol we had is that if they needed to get me urgently they would call her because she was always at my side. And they came over to a meeting in the main floor of the Sheridan. It was an intense meeting. But we briefed the Board that evening and Tamara Lich requested that all of the road captains, all legal, the board members all assemble at Sussex -- or Rideau and Sussex the next morning prior to 10:00 a.m. in an effort -- an all-out effort to use their persuasive skills. We had an initial success where there was a LoadSafe truck that you’ll see lots of picture -- LoadSafe is what was on the logo on the side of the cargo trailer of the semitruck and it was parked by the valet area of the Chateau Laurier and it was pulled up on angle almost jackknife blocking almost four lanes and the police did not like it all. They had been trying to move it and I was standing with a large group of PLTs, Ms. Lich, and others. Mr. Barber came up. We said, “Hey.” I said, “Chris” -- or one of us said to Chris, “Is there any way you could go talk to that guy?” And as you heard, we all watched in amazement; Chris jumped up on the step and was hanging onto the mirror, the window came down, he started visiting with a few minutes and all of the sudden, Chris hollered out for truckers to come and set up a perimeter to safely back him up and the backup alarm went on and they repositioned him so he was right up against the curb.

15-046-18,"So what happened was we had a bunch of failed attempts to get the -- enough truckers to agree. We always had the Polish guys at the front that were ready to go. So a lot of the team -- or those of that were there to try and clear that intersection were done. It was a very, very cold day. I was back and forth trying to keep warm in the lobby of the Chateau Laurier. That’s when I got served with one of the seizure orders and was dealing with the TD Bank on interpleader. There was so many things going on all the time. In any event, we had largely given up. It was just about to get dark and then one of the PLTs came out of the area. And he came up -- and Tamara was with me and a couple of others -- and said, “They’re ready to go.” And Tamara’s like, “Well, then let’s do it.” So they called in the big heavy-lift equipment to lift the barricade and they ended up bringing a tow truck as well a flatbed tow truck because, as you may have saw in one of those pictures, they have these orange mechanical devices that are actually bolted to the ground and when the vehicle drives over it, it comes up behind it. So we were waiting. It was now getting dark and, as was typical, is you get into four or five o’clock, six o’clock, the number of Ottawa residents and others that would start to converge in the downtown would significantly increase each night. This was typical of that. Well, when the trucks and the heavy equipment arrived, they’ve got yellow flashing lights; they have backup alarms. That caused even more people to come. Because we were anticipating moving the trucks up past the War Memorial to Wellington, we needed -- the police were obviously handling this part of it -- more police to create a safety corridor so that no one got run over. And as the one vehicle backed up, and its alarm was very loud, people started to rush in. Tamara had been removing from the barricades the signs. No one else -- the police were smart not to go and taking signs down. It was Tamara. And she was recognized so she would place the signs over on another railing by the Senate to get the barricades ready to be removed safely without controversy, hopefully. Just as the equipment was going, people rushed behind the tow truck because they seemed to think that the police were about to do something bad to the truckers. I was talking to them. Tamara was individually talking to groups of people, “It’s okay. This is a cooperative move. We’re trying to clear this intersection. The truckers want to move up to Wellington.” And then people would sit on a barricade. Tamara would go talk to them. They’d apologize, get off the barricade. She’d turn around and they were on another -- different people were on another barricade. And then the police were further in. Tamara and I were trying to talk to as many people as we could to explain that it was okay, “This is a cooperative move. We’re just trying to clear an intersection.” And then the people just swarmed in, and that’s where the video plays.",15-046-20,46,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. JEFFREY LEON,MR.

The more dominant theme of the plan was for the vehicles to move to the remote locations at Embrun Exit 88 and Arnprior and to have -- expand the shuttle busses that were already running. And there was also -- this is a very important point and I don’t know that it’s come out yet, is a lot of people who were there, the truckers, never planned to stay that long but the Canadians they met along the way, and the stories and the heartache that they heard, and the trust and plea that they heard from those people, many of the truckers I talked to felt this obligation to stay as long as they could but they also needed a way to leave gracefully and respectfully. And one of the things we recognized was that if 75 percent of the vehicles were going to be given an opportunity leave and go out to Embrun or Arnprior, that some would actually use it as an opportunity to go home and do so respectfully.

And because of the significance of this, even though on Friday they had all agreed to proceed to proceed with the deal with the mayor, I wanted to get something documented, so I sent an email to all of the Board.

There was not a strong desire to have a meeting with the prime minister. It was more with the ministers, and that we could agree on a process of formally presenting briefs and information and scientific information to support -- and comparative information, because Canada was anomaly at this time in terms of our mandates; the other G7 countries weren’t doing these things -- to try and persuade the government to review its policies.",15-054-11,54,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Le, with the mayor's chief of staff and with the city manager. We -- the reports I was getting from the ground were that the police were not in a position, they were getting blocked at different phases by the police. They finally got some trucks moved. We were ready to move trucks again on the Tuesday. Chris had worked and others, Joe Janz and Ryan and Dale and others had gone out and worked hard to get a whole bunch of trucks ready to move on the Tuesday. Police completely blocked it. We now see all the bad communications and infighting that was going on. We didn't know that at the time, obviously, and then again, on the Wednesday. And the other thing is, we realized, when we discussed it and I listened to the road captains and to the Chris Barbers, is they felt that once the big trucks moved, there would be stragglers, but they wouldn't want to be alone, and that they would either leave or they may go and infill a little bit, but so we recognized that. And there was also discussion that if -- and this is controversial, but there was also discussion that if we get down to a few areas where everybody else has either gone up to Wellington, or gone out to the base camps, or gone home, and we have a few holdouts, that Freedom Corp. would no longer provide any supplies, fuel, or materials to those areas to incentivize them to follow the lead of everyone else who was leaving downtown.",15-055-08,55,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

15-056-17,"Correct. And just to clarify, the letter's signed by Ms. Chipiuk, but I did review the letter, and we also had at least four or five other lawyers from the Justice Centre reviewing the same statutory regulatory instruments, and we had all reached the same conclusion that the description that the government officials and the police were using to describe the measures was not even close to what the Emergency Proclamation actually said, and that as long as you were not seeking to interfere with international trade, disrupt or interfere with critical infrastructure or engage in serious acts of violence against persons, you continued to have the right of political advocacy, protest and dissent.

So I knew of him from then and I knew that he was a very loud voice. When I found out that he was here, I told him I was -- I told the clients I wasn't prepared to be in the same room with him. There was one instance where he was brought into a room, and I immediately requested that he leave. The reason was that I had heard of his language at times, and maybe it was unfair to him, maybe I was duped by the media. I don't know, but there was inuendo of violence, and it was completely unacceptable to me, but more importantly, Ms. Lich. Because the Legacy media was repeating it so many times and it was needing to be explained so many times, the Board made the decision to issue this press release.

15-130-24,"To be perfectly honest, I think it was a case of fear. I had over the time of COVID noticed things that I had never before believed that I would see in Canada related to the way the police and bylaw and the government were going after Canadians. And for the first time in my life I was, you know, actually afraid of police. And I have several friends that are police officers. And I had a phone call with Randy Hillier one day. And Randy didn’t know who I was. This was -- I sent an email to him and Roman and other people and months later his office had returned the call. And Randy doesn't even recall the conversation. And I said, “You know, I spent 25 years of my life in the military and for the first time I'm actually afraid in my own country.” And he said, “You know, never be afraid. You can’t be afraid of the police or the government. They’re here to serve us.” And I think for me that kind of flipped a switch where I was like I went from thinking I'm afraid to get arrested or beaten by the police or getting an $880 fine to, “You know what? Now I want the fine. I’m done. I’m not going to hide from these people anymore.” And that started to mentally transition the way I thought. And then we came to a point where I thought, “Well, at some point the lawyers are going to step in and intervene and start protecting the public,” and they didn’t, except for a few. Then when the Covid mandates -- the vaccine came out, I thought, “Well, the community’s going to stand up and put a stop to this because of informed consent.” And they didn’t, except for a few.

I remember Brigitte being quite upset with Sergeant Li where she had made a comment of -- basically to the effect of, “What, are you going to shoot us in the streets?” Like, that’s where the level had gone. And it had started to calm down. Eventually, the two police officers departed from the meeting and we all just kind of sat around and regrouped. I think people went for breaks. And then we -- people left the room. I remember Brigitte and I being in the room and right around that time I think somebody brought in the map. And so I had learned there was a list of places that the OPS had requested that we not go near, like roads that we stay off of, and I said, “Okay, great, we’ve got the map. Let’s start marking the map.” And for me what was really important, because I had spent -- my son has a very severe heart condition and I spent Christmas this year in the hospital with my son. And so, you know, I’m very aware of keeping the emergency lanes open; it’s an important issue for me. So the first thing we did was start identifying hospitals. We identified the police station, fire departments, vulnerable infrastructure, and then started to plan out the routes to those in an effort to really make sure those lanes were always accessible. So that’s really where we started. And then we -- I needed to get a handle on where all the vehicles were located and that was a monumental task because, at the time, trucks were coming into the city, trucks were leave the city, there was a huge just change in our overall size of the convoy overall.

I wanted them to come and sit literally at a table and start figuring out a way to be an effective opposition to the Liberal Party of Canada, because we weren't seeing any opposition at all with the official opposition of Canada. You know, if the Conservative Party had been effective as being an opposition, we may not be in this room today. But instead, they just didn't oppose anything that was happening to Canadians as to why we were there. And when we got there, there was no attempt at any level of government, municipal, provincial, federal government to even talk to us, to get in a room with us.

Two days later, I tried to clarify that, or three days later, but what we wanted was for the government, anybody. We were desperate. It was a -- basically, a cry for help to come in and sit down and do this democratically. And that is a mechanism of government, because as we've seen since then, or even during the convoy, the NDP and the Liberals were forming a coalition that the public had not yet known about.

I believe the Coventry raid was the sixth; that was the seventh. I wanted to deal directly with the police because I felt that the police were the ones that were getting the most pressure and I thought that I would be able to have a conversation with the police and try to work with them, build a rapport, because I wasn’t getting anywhere, that I felt, with the two police liaison sergeants I was dealing with. I felt that if we could develop a better rapport with the police, then things would change. Second to that is, the Police Services Board meeting that we had seen the rhetoric from Diane Dean, was just incredible. And I don’t know if that meeting was before or after the 7th.

And I got a little bit more concerned again so I rewound it and I watched it again; I watched her comments; I watched his reaction and I knew right there and then that the situation had fundamentally changed for all of us, them as well as us. And I realized that if we didn’t do something to take the pressure off of the Chief, things were going to dramatically change for the worse. And so that’s when we started to completely re-shift our focus to taking the pressure off the Chief, thereby taking the pressure off of the individual police officers and hopefully ourselves.",15-160-04,160,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

15-160-26,"He did, but I think I heard -- we actually had -- we were -- to use a football analogy, we were on the one-yard line with all the trucks on that corner. And Eva and I had spent hours on that corner. Eva was talking with the Polish truckers, I was talking with the English-speaking French truckers. We spent hours there. And we finally got -- because Sergeant Lee was there and despite his best efforts, sometimes he can be a little bit hostile. And we -- I had asked the truckers to basically, as a group, come to an agreement with themselves and then also elect two people to go in and deal directly with Sergeant Lee, because I was actually concerned that if he went into the center of those 80 truckers, he would do something that would put his own safety at risk. So instead of him going to them, I said you elect two people, come out and then we’ll talk. And then Sergeant Lee got that phone call. He walked away and he came back and the look on his face said everything. I knew that he had just had the carpet pulled out from under his legs and he said “There’s no deal”. And so I was very concerned. I knew I couldn’t go back to the truckers and say, “Hey, we spent all day convincing you to do this and now the police have reneged on it”. I knew that there would be no further chance of ever getting them to even be open to the idea of moving had I gone back and delivered that message to them. So it was -- we were there; we were there that night to move them. And I just basically went back and I said, “Listen guys, it’s a safety issue; we’re not going to move at night because it’s too dangerous for the safety of people with decreased visibility.

He is the creator of a fictitious meme on the internet known as Diagolon, which I assume what you're going to ask me about, and the vice-president of Diagolon being a time-travelling cocaine addicted goat. That is just an internet meme that has no meaning at all, and I had spoken to Jeremy the first time when I was in Ottawa on the phone. And the second time I spoke to Jeremy was when the Liberal government was debating whether or not they should use the Emergency Act, and they were citing this fictitious goat that time travels as a domestic terrorist group and justification for invoking the Emergency Act. And I saw a video that Jeremy and his friends were doing, and they were laughing hysterically, showing clips of the government actually talking about Diagolon as being a real thing. Everybody knew it was a joke. When I saw the video I contacted Jeremy and I said, “Tell me everything there is to know about Diagolon.” He said, “If you draw a diagonal line from Alaska through Alberta to Texas it makes a diagonal line. And that’s why it’s called Diagolon. They’re the only states and provinces that don’t have mask mandates. And he used it as a joke. He made the symbol for Diagolon in a second on his cell phone because it’s a joke. And it is meaningless. He did it to attract attention for people to come to a barbecue and to have a lot of fun that were, you know, people wanted to have a barbecue without masks on, a bunch of strangers that didn’t know each other. And yet here he was, watching member of Parliament and the Liberal Party actually seriously stating that the reason for invoking the Emergency Act was because of Diagolon. Like, it was the most outrageous ridiculous thing I had ever seen. And I think this Commission should be investigating that as the biggest Intelligence joke of the last decade. So it’s a joke.

And, you know, there is a video of it I’m sure of me bringing it up, and you know, it was a very frustrating phone call that I had with the OPP, but I said we would recommend it.

15-206-22,"It -- you know, if you were to look at what the City of Toronto was doing, because I was living, at the time, close. I was just in the Barry area, so I was looking at what the Toronto Police were doing, what the Premier was doing with all the lockdowns. The lockdowns made absolutely no sense. The vilification of Canadians by the Prime Minister of Canada was shocking; so deeply disturbing to hear him talk about Canadians the way he did. That’s just one of the examples. Premier Doug Ford, in the rhetoric that he had -- and the other big thing for me, which was really, really shocking to me, was that they did not exercise or use Emergency Management Ontario to manage this entire pandemic for this province. It was mindboggling to me, and I knew about them because I actually worked with the EMO representative, who was a retired Brigadier General, when I was posted to the Headquarters in Toronto. And so my expectation was to handle this pandemic, you would have used the very institution within each province that is meant to handle a pandemic. So I knew things were fundamentally upside down with the approach that the government was using. And you would see subsequent effects of those decisions, which were, you know, shut down a department store, stop selling kids clothing, and stuff like that. But you can go and get a case of beer, that’s no problem. Right? So there was -- there was a lot of stuff that were just so absurd. And, cumulatively, after a while that starts to build up this amount of anxiety and fear. And I know a lot of people that I was talking to, especially when I was campaigning, were recounting their time during the lockdowns. And they felt the same fear that I did of the police, which is really unusual. I didn’t want to go out in public because honestly, I thought that I was going to be -- it would take nothing for the police to come for any infraction and start arresting people for the most bizarre things. I mean, we saw a year and a half ago two Calgary police officers pointed a taser and threatened to arrest a young kid who was playing hockey out in Calgary, you know? And the next day, Police on Guard went public because there were law enforcement in this country that were just appalled by what was going on in this country, and they decided to start becoming public in defending what they thought was massive breaches of the Charter, which they spend their whole careers defending the Charter. And so when the police started to push back to organizations like Police on Guard or later on, the Mounties for Freedom, when the police started to push back, that was a sign that things had really, really gone off the rails, for me. So cumulatively, there were just too many things to ignore in this society right now. But I think the worst thing for me was when the convoy was rolling through and I wasn’t part of it, the statements coming from the prime minister of this country were terrifying, disgusting, just unbecoming of a prime minister of a country, you know, of people that actually voted him into represent, and he was acting like he was a king. And it was appalling. And it's certainly not what I joined the Canadian military to defend; nothing of the sort. So I just didn’t know how we could possibly call ourselves a free country any more if our prime minister was allowed to get away with the rhetoric he was getting away with.

I had just assumed that it was very much like this protest in Ottawa where citizens just said, ""We're seeing Ottawa as an example that you can actually do something."" And I think the Ottawa protest was an inspiration for a lot of people, and what I later learned was that there was 20 convoys around the world, and they were all saying that they were inspired by the convoy in Ottawa.

15-214-09,"Yeah. These were convoys. From my understanding, what happens -- so for example, a convoy came in from New Brunswick, and as they got into the city, they had a plan to stick together. And as soon as they got here and they interacted with the Ottawa Police, the Ottawa Police started directing that particular convoy, as an example, New Brunswick, and that entire convoy got spread out all over the place. Same thing came from the West, same thing came from Quebec. So when they came in here, they expected they drove in together, they'd stay together, but they were spread out like buckshot all over all of the streets. So you couldn't say that hey, the convoy from New Brunswick that started with 50 trucks, as an example, were still confined to 50 trucks over on a certain area. They just literally got spread out all over the place and nobody can control that. So we were trying to organize ourselves in a way that we could get effective communication going between the ARC and the -- and every single individual truck driver. We just wanted to reduce our span of control to the convoy leader from New Brunswick just to talk to that person, you go share it.

I understand that you referenced the -- the information that's at stake there is a letter which mentions Ms. Lich's name.

PLT liaised with the ruck driver that was stuck and with the protestors and were able to work out the opening of the bridge, so that was a success. The bridge did reopen.

19-239-24,"Right. So right around the commercial inspection site, you can see the highway here is actually east to west for all of a mile, from the intersection, from the yellow bold point to about the Welcome to Alberta sign. At that time, that highway, both lanes, both directions was full of motorized vehicles, anything from tractor trailers, to trucks, to whatever it was on the highway. And the RCMP staged close to the railroad with I would say a hundred officers and started to commence enforcement in the form of knocking on the vehicles that the truckers or the protestors were in their vehicles and asking them to leave or face arrest. So one by one, they -- it was a pretty obvious decision for most. You know, it was time to leave. They were able to work their way down one lane, truck by truck, without any ability to -- without us -- giving us any ability to respond or do anything about it; right? We were watching it from our vehicles, and we seen the RCMP come closer. This was all being streamed on many social media platforms, Facebook, Tik Tok, Telegram and others. So you have these individuals at the Milk River blockade who are looking to get to Coutts, who have been -- and we're talking it was a balmy weekend. You know, 10 degrees into January, but Monday morning, the weather turned sour, and it was minus 30 that first week. So you're talking about individuals who are looking to get to Coutts, who are in their -- camped out in their vehicles in extreme temperatures. They are seeing enforcement action -- and a lot of these individuals were farmers, like, there was a lot of equipment there. These were neighbours. These were people we knew or were acquaintances to others at Coutts since the 29th. So they see this happening on their screens. And without us being aware -- we seen the video after -- they proceeded to essentially hit the ditch or go around the police barricade, which was on -- I believe it was parked on the pavement, and they had been civil in regards to obeying that blockade, but once they seen the RCMP enforcing in Coutts, obviously, it starts with one or two and the rest followed. But most of that blockade was able to traverse that -- most of -- sorry, most of the supporters were able to traverse the blockade and make their way down the highway, both lanes, toward Coutts.

19-243-28,"Correct. Right. They had been -- I believe they were part of the initial slow roll. You know, the RCMP was aware of the slow roll so they had officers and they had sent staff down to monitor the situation. So they had been there from the onset of the protest. Initially, the RCMP took the heavy handed approach regarding enforcement. The failure of that resulted in a direction from RCMP to -- toward more of a negotiation stance. And even that, they came in fairly heavy. They showed up in the saloon and they essentially ordered us off the highway, and that was met with a very decisive ""no"" by everybody involved.",19-243-30,243,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MS.

19-244-15,"So due to the situation on the ground and the enforcement action, we were aware the RCMP -- you know, our fight was never the RCMP. That was the enforcement. We were looking to get the attention of our province, the government. We had been trying unsuccessfully to do that for two years, or two years or eighteen months at that time. And obviously we knew the RCMP would respond and commence with enforcement and possibly communication. But the RCMP was never -- that was never -- when I say the struggle, that wasn't -- they were never part of that, they were automatically involved. So they came into the saloon, and we worked out an agreement, which also came from a position of we have to, I wouldn't say retreat, we have to work with the RCMP due to our position. That our position was based on how many trucks, how many people do we have, right, strength in numbers. Or, you know, if we have too bold of a position without the equipment and the trucks and the people to back it up the RCMP may enforce. If we open up some lanes, we go -- we're -- we look like a -- then we are a legal protest in the eyes of the -- in the view of the RCMP, and they may let us stay to fight. And when I say ""fight"", I, you know, I don't want to use that in a term other than we were there to fight another day. And that is what happened. I believe either late in the evening of the 1st or the morning of the 2nd, we, through communication with the RCMP, and obviously the concerns of the Village of Coutts by having most of their access restricted, we -- actually there were three things.

And that was -- it was a tricky business to maintain that position where the one side wants to -- wants you off the highway yesterday, and we had to stay on that highway just long enough to possibly enter in -- not necessarily negotiations but to open up lines of communication with the provincial government. So we brought in trucks, we brought in tractors -- and when we say, “We,” people brought tractors. It was very organic. We never said no to anybody that wanted to come and support us who came from anywhere in southern Alberta -- or, sorry; Western Canada. Ottawa was obviously the initial draw and the event here was to support Ottawa. At the same time that Ottawa rolled -- or the Freedom Convoy rolled into Ottawa, we rolled into Coutts.

When the second one showed up, the RCMP and the Province have notes that speak to no construction activity being in the vicinity and it being noted and them being very aware of two excavators on the side of the highway, you know, as to, “What’s going on here? Who’s doing this?” When the third one rolled in, it resulted in a very -- it resulted in a heavy response; 40 officers descended on that field and on those individuals operating those HIYOs, and they were ordered to retreat. I got the phone call. At that time I was actually in a meeting with some -- with individuals in Milk River, and I had taken -- I took the call, and, you know, they explained the situation and I had said, “Okay, well, you know, just hold them back. It’s never our intention -- there is no intentions here other than to, you know, cause a distraction, fly some flags.” So they retreated over the hill. There was a misunderstanding that they would be removed from the area fully. Unfortunately it took three days to bring them into the area, and the trucker, he has 13 hours a day to legally operate. He was not -- he did not have the ability to remove those. I had a family weekend planned for months prior and I had the ability to sneak away for 10 hours. And to get there I went through -- it’s called the Whiskey Gap, and it’s without service. So as I was rolling into this part of the country, just outside the Milk River blockade, I got a call from -- well, I think I sent Greg and Troy a text message because I knew they were off, like, they had two different groups of CCMDs, so Chris and Mark were on on Sunday, and Greg and Troy, you know, it was a frustrating day and there a lot of tension regarding the excavators, but it was resolved, in my mind. And I said, “Hey, have a good weekend, and see you next week,” is what I had said. And I got the call that, “The understanding was to move these excavators out of the area, and they are not gone.” And I had said, “Well, we can move them further, you know, but we can’t get them out of the area right away.

So we were talking about what had happened, and the fairly heavy-handed approach that the RCMP initially took and how that was de-escalated, et cetera. And the question came in, ""So what about the guns?"" And I had to respond and said, ""What guns?"" Ten (10) minutes later, I knew what guns we were talking about. For me, it became very clear that this was no longer -- that every objective we were looking to achieve was no longer possible and that our message had been lost. And to distance ourselves from any -- and this has to be determined yet; right? These charges have not gone to court for these individuals charged with conspiracy to commit or any related gun charges, so I'm not going to speak to that. But to distance ourselves from that, even the perception at that time, and anything to do with that, we made the decision to leave. And I remember calling that meeting and having that discussion. And obviously, it was unfortunate. It was not us. It was obviously individuals who were among us that had different -- and like I said, this is to be proven. I can't speak to that but alleged to have different views than us. And I remember having that discussion and there was pushback initially, and I had said, ""I'm leaving. And the majority of the individuals will leave with me, but I would like to leave together."" And I had -- I remember I had said, ""Google Coutts."" You know, I was keeping an eye on mainstream media, et cetera. I was aware of Ottawa and such, but I wasn't aware of everything, but I remember saying, ""Google Coutts."" And any of the messages, any of the videos, any of the positivity around what we were doing, in my view, was lost. It was guns, guns, guns. And to be -- to not be associated with that or even that viewpoint, we arranged, and we arranged to leave.

19-268-20,"Right. So we had gone to the RCMP after we had talked to the DOJ, like Department of Justice. We had requested a Zoom with them. So we had that discussion, and then we had gone to the protest, because it was always -- it was never my decision or -- it was always a group decision we were leaving or we were -- we were going or we're staying. And I do remember having to address the group with that, and based on the situation and the information flowing around, it was a pretty -- you know, I didn't have to tell anybody to be quiet when I started to address the crowd. And there was some opposition. You know, we still have individuals coming in that were full of fight. You know, like, they wanted to be part of this, and they had showed up 15 minutes ago. And we were 18 days. We were pretty battered. So it was also a way to end this. There was no plan, so there was never a plan to end this, and this was, for us, a strategic retreat, victory retreat, whatever you want to call it. It is what it is. But we negotiated -- by noon, we had talked to the RCMP is we'd like to leave. Supper's cooking. We're going to invite people over legally one more time to do what we did. The tractors will be off the highway immediately and we will start -- we will commence cleanup efforts. Initially, the RCMP's -- they phoned it in. Their response was very heavy. They said, ""You need to leave immediately, and we want you gone in an hour."" And I remember thinking this is just crazy, and I just -- I walked away, essentially. And they went back in their vehicles and five minutes later, they came back and says, ""Okay. Nine o'clock. Tractors last."" You know, it was just last little bit of a, you know, power struggle, whatever it was. I thought whatever. We'll do tractors last and didn't matter to me. Didn't matter to us.

19-269-28,"Well, we've covered a lot. I just -- I want to speak to what Coutts was. It was a gathering of truckers, mainly farmers, eventually farmers bolstered the ranks, but it was a group of -- and the perception around Coutts, unfortunately, due to the discovery of the guns and such, has tainted what Coutts was. And, for me, what’s important is that we were there to demand that our representatives communicate with us like they are obligated to do and like what had not been happening. And there’s lots of different events during those days that I almost think it was like a chess game between the RCMP and the protesters. But, unfortunately, we were never able to enter in official communication with the government, but looking back at the political state of affairs in Alberta, it might have been better for the Kenney government to actually have done that. And -- because, at the end of the day, we’re Albertans and we’re Canadians, and the Covid restrictions and the mandates, they messed with our lives. Like, we see the inconsistencies of the experts. And I don’t necessarily blame them. The information provided was what they went off, and that information is, at times -- is now no longer factual either. Things -- you know, the ball kept on getting pushed further down the road. “Two weeks to flatten the curve,” and look at where we are now. And I’m not going to speak to Covid, and I’m no expert on it, but even the experts got it wrong.

19-271-07,"Good afternoon. For the record, my name is Stephanie Bowes. I’m appearing today on behalf of the Government of Alberta. Most of my questions have already been answered but I would like to cover off a few areas with you today. You’ve talked a little bit about your role as an unofficial spokesperson for the protesters at Coutts. And were there any other unofficial spokespeople at the same time that you were acting in that role?",19-271-09,271,9,7,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. STEPHANIE BOWES,MS. STEPHANIE BOWES,stephanie bowes
19-271-16,"There was individuals. The media, in the beginning, once their became -- once there was some organization -- you know, the event was organic, but once there was some organization established in regards to food, and logistics, and things like that, right. You have 200-and-some people in a place, you’ve got to establish some kind of structure. Once that was established and once it became more or less -- once I got pushed into the role of dealing with media, I dealt with the media. And there was certain media that had been chasing me around -- or chasing individuals around looking for some kind of comment. I remember one particular reporter who had finally, in frustration, said, “You want us -- how can we tell the world what’s going on here if you won’t talk to us?” And I won’t speak to the organization but obviously my view on that organization was why we were in that situation and I had turned and responded. I said, “Okay, you’re going to get an interview and I’ll be watching tonight, but that will determine whether you get another one tomorrow.” And I actually was able to say that my views on the organization may not have changed but I had a very, very positive relationship with this reporter and that has -- that has since then given me the discretion with other reporters to hear them out. But we had advised protesters to not speak to the media and that we were trying to orchestrate a general communication and general direction in regards to what came from Coutts, but individuals may have, on their accord, done interviews and stuff, and I’ve see those. And, you know, like I said, there was -- it’s not like the RCMP where there was such structure that you didn’t move left or right unless you were told to. We -- you know, we were there for freedom so it wasn’t like -- it wasn’t for us to go and order people around and tell them not to do this or not to do that.",19-271-18,271,18,16,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

STEPHANIE BOWES,MS. STEPHANIE BOWES,stephanie bowes
19-272-26,"Correct. Yeah, so the RCMP had their initial blockade which was in -- on the -- January the 1st, the protesters went around it, so they reinforced it to the point where there was no longer any way to go through that other than going through the barricade, you know, which was never -- which would have resulted in violence, which was never an intention. But due to the numbers, which fluctuated on the weekends, and the first and the second weekend being obviously quite phenomenal due to the influx of people, thousands -- I believe we had over 10,000 on the Saturday, Saturday the -- I’m going to the 6th, I believe, but people had to take care of themselves, you know, sleeping accommodations, food, et cetera. There was individuals at the front that maintained -- to make sure we didn’t have anybody come in and cause problems, right? We were weary of people looking to come in and make us look -- you know, start something, and that it would be on us, right? So we were aware of that and just -- there was fires there so we made sure that the fires were contained and there was a general -- there was few individual at the Milk River protest that kept an eye on things and if things, you know, went a certain way, they would coordinate with the RCMP to make sure that was either resolved or de-escalated. But the biggest thing was to make sure that we didn’t have -- and I remember the thought and I’m not going to - - you know, that Antifa could show up and cause problems. And obviously, for myself, you know, being in the public eye, I had -- we had a fairly -- you know, we had threats to myself and to my family and I remember when I would go down to Milk River multiple times a day, or as needed, and it came to a point where I wasn’t alone. I would be accompanied by an individual or two just for my -- due to the worries of the protesters about my wellbeing. So it was less organized but, you know, I wouldn’t -- they were -- there was a lot of structure there, too, at the front, but on the weekends it was you took care of yourself, you know. Like, we called them “the weekend warriors”, you know; they showed up in droves.

19-299-04,"Due to the cold weather and the equipment, if you're familiar with trucks and equipment in general, the batteries, if they do not run on a regular basis, the batteries will drain. So to prevent that sporadically and at different times, we would fire up all the equipment and let the equipment run. That was -- that occurred the night of -- so that occurred Sunday night on the 13th. And then Chris and Mark, two CCMGs. I don't recall their last names. They were the second shift, and Greg and Troy were a team, and Chris and Mark were a team. They were in front of the saloon, standing around the fire, doing what their role was, you know, community conflict group. Like, they were there interacting, and I'm pretty sure they were taking mental notes as to what we were up to, but there was a -- I think there was a gospel band playing in the saloon, and people were mingling, and families that -- or, sorry, people that couldn't be there on the week were there on a Sunday night. And it was a very quiet evening. And all the -- you know, the decision, or whatever it was, it was a minor thing to fire up all the tractors. You know, there was things happened on a daily and we tried to coordinate structure. And so all the tractors fired up. Unfortunately, one of these tractors -- one of these individuals decided to go for a little joyride with one of these tractors. And this drew the attention of the RCMP, and I'm going to say specifically, looking back, specifically, the SWAT or tactical teams that were in place to execute these warrants of that night, which we were not aware of, but they were in the vicinity. So being dark, they must have been within a couple minute response time, just waiting for the time to execute their warrants on the location outside of the protest in connection to the guns. This individual and this tractor triggered a response by these tactical teams, but prior to this, this tractor -- the first vehicle on site was an administrative vehicle. It was an unmarked RCMP vehicle with a staff member who works in administration, so who may have had -- received the training previously to be in the field, but was, you know -- they were short officers. Everybody was short officers. There was a lot of draw for the RCMP across the country, so they had a lot of individuals that were usually working desk jobs, et cetera, manning checkpoints. So this person must have been in the nearest checkpoint responding to this tractor driving around and what's going on. And this tractor ended up -- I can't speak for the individual driving this tractor, but from what I seen, this big tractor -- and if you're not familiar with tractors, they can be very intimidating all on their own parked. Now this tractor was driving around, and there was intention -- or, sorry, intention -- there was an unintended confrontation in an intersection where you have a little SUV manned by a RCMP officer who was obviously very intimidated by this piece of equipment. And it resulted in an altercation that was eventually de-escalated but resulted in this tractor being seized.",19-299-06,299,6,4,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

19-301-09,The issue with the premier's announcement of February 8th.

19-301-15,"Correct. So if I go back to the documents that were presented to us, the difference between these documents, which are very, very solid, and provide a clear plan as to the phased approach the province was taking, we were never responding to this document. We were responding to the premier's speech. This document was not available to us at that time. The premier's speech was a speech that in no way even mentioned the situation in Coutts. And we were not looking for recognition, but it nowhere mentioned. And what it did mention was a lot of maybes which we -- if we had the speech, we could bring it up. So we responded to the premier's wording, the tone, and everything around his address. We did not respond to a document that showed a phased approach. This document, in and of itself, is actually a fairly reasonable document, but that was not what we were responding to.",19-301-17,301,17,15,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

19-303-09,"Absolutely. And not specifically Coutts. I do believe in regards to -- if Coutts were the only protest happening, we would have got the attention, the full attention of the federal government, but Ottawa and Ambassador Bridge were the draw. You know, Alberta and how that was affecting -- how Coutts was affecting Alberta is something the Alberta government was aware of, but in the evidence provided, there is an exchange between Bill Blair and Ric McIver, and there's six or seven days where there is no response to a request by Ric McIver for assistance by the federal government to removing or assisting in removing the blockade, until the minister texts Ric McIver and essentially says, ""Oh, by the way, we invoked the Emergencies Act,"" which obviously set off a pretty heated exchange between the two. So it goes to show you that for six, seven days, there was no communication between the federal and the provincial governments, so that obviously put Coutts on a -- Coutts was of little concern to the federal government as a whole. It was a concern. Like, they were addressing it, but not on the same level as Ottawa or as the Ambassador Bridge, and I can understand that. But the EMA was enacted as a -- in my view, as a political tactic more than a actual enforcement tactic.",19-303-11,303,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

09-043-04,"Sure. So on the Friday, for the most part the arrivals were actually very -- for the most part were orderly. People were -- the convoys were going to locations that were predesignated, and areas that we -- again, it goes back to we were expecting a few thousand and it still exceeded what we were -- what we actually, truly expected. And my personal opinion is it probably exceeded what the organizers were expecting. But on that Friday, people were going to places we designated, where we were actually -- if you look at those -- on the maps, on the Parkways and on Wellington we were doing everything we could to keep them out of the residential areas. The analogy I use is I have one load of sandbags and we’re building a wall, but you see the waters are rising faster and you know you’re going to get overwhelmed with the water that’s coming. So you use your sandbags to divert them to minimize and mitigate the damages and the impacts to the area that it going to be the recipient of those floodwaters. And that’s what we were trying to do. But what happened was on the Saturday, the Western convoy arrived. Unfortunately, they’re the ones that created this event and they didn’t get the locations downtown. It was other people that raced downtown to get that. So what had happened was people who were frustrated that were individual operators who wanted to take part weren’t complying with the directions and we were redirecting them, trying to keep intersections, emergency roads clear. And -- but they would start to weave through different side streets, so that would -- in those individual vehicles that were going off the planning and the agreements that were in place originally with the various leaders and organizers of the convoys, we’re creating one-offs; we’re drawing one more resource here, one more resource there. And it got to the point it was, okay, we have to stop responding to those individual, smaller ones on the Saturday and indicate where are we going to get the biggest bang for our buck by deploying officers to go back to what is our key primary goal of public safety.",09-043-06,43,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

You mentioned that it was your view and your knowledge that the OPS had dealt with two previous trucker protests involving the same sort of mandate or issue.

09-072-27,"No, so the community impact was actually -- was part of the consideration right from the beginning. So if you actually were to go to the original plan and take a look at where they were diverting the trucks to, they were away from residential areas. And if you look -- like, put them along the Sir John A. MacDonald Parkway and onto Wellington, we were trying to find places where they were trying to go that we would actually minimize the impact on that. There was no plan to put them down the length of Kent Street to double and triple stack on Kent and block Kent and things like that. that was never part of the original plan. And on the Friday, that’s not what took place. And again, like I state, when we look at alternate locations, we can’t put them on to people’s private property. So the City, being a great partner, provided RCGT, and those trucks that actually arrived on Friday night that went there, they actually carpooled to go downtown to actually minimize the impacts to downtown. So there were a lot of wins, but what happened was the size and scope, and I know I’ve said this numerous times, and -- but it exceeded everybody’s expectations, and I would probably say even that of the organizers weren’t expecting the volume that we ended up -- and what happened was, when we got that volume, it just pulled our resources too thin to address those concerns.",09-072-29,72,29,27,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

So it’s about how do we manage -- they are going to Parliament Hill. That is the focus of their event. So how do we minimize and control, in the planning process, as much as possible to mitigate those impacts on the local community? And, you know, we’ve learned a lot of good lessons.

09-076-09,"Yes. And there’s a couple really good examples. So the -- I’ve learned a lot. and the power of social media has evolved and it continues to evolve.

So we always refer people back to our website to look for true information. Misinformation comes when people are sending out unintentionally wrong information, and then it gets shared, and then you’re trying to put that genie back in the bottle. And then the other issue was the disinformation, where people are knowingly putting out false information, which is drawing on resources or creating a different narrative that you’re trying to deal with. So, like, for example, the wooden fence that’s protecting the construction site on Parliament Hill was being shared repeatedly, over and over again, saying they’re fortifying Parliament Hill in advance of the arrival of convoys. And it was enflaming people. But you’re trying to get the information out through your PLTs. It’s there. There’s construction. There’s a big pit on the other side. We don’t want people to get hurt.

You want to -- if people are running at a nine or a 10 emotionally, you need to bring it down a level. So if that means being friendly with them and having a chat with them and taking a picture with them so that people are getting more relaxed and it doesn’t turn into a confrontation, that’s what, traditionally, we have encouraged our officers to do.

As you said, their schedule of events ran until I think Monday morning, and then there were no other planned events.

09-094-19,"Completely -- that's not correct. So what happens is people look at the cover and they think it's the same plan, it's not. We follow a template, but the data and the information is constantly changed for that specific event. We use a template to ensure we are not missing things, and it helps cover off the planning process. Those with a military background or even at Ad Hoc Incident Command is -- we call it SMEAC: Situation, Mission, Execution, Administrative Support, Command and Control. And those are -- that's a planning standard that's been used for 50, 60 years as the natal standard for planning, and the reason is for interoperability to exchange information and the people know where to find that in a plan right away.

So they need the autonomy -- a bit of autonomy to be able to do stuff that’s not going to affect the overall operation to make those -- a certain level of decisions, which they just didn't have. And -- but when they started getting some of it back, for example, at the Confederation Park, they saw phenomenal success. It was slow, but it was great success.

09-103-10,"So there’s two parts to the that. So the first part is, under the ICS model, there’s a planning, logistics, finance, and what happens is we pull them out away from the operations in the incident command and let them work offsite with information we’re feeding them of what those operations and preparing our next planning cycle and things like that that’s going to exceed. And that’s what we’d be looking for, because we’re -- at this point, the plan has changed multiple times based on the changing dynamics. And again, once we realized the size and scope of what we had was substantially larger than what we anticipated, then we’re adapting and we’re trying to flex through that. When we get through the first weekend and we’re looking at options -- because one of the -- what we’ve done before is we have had people stay behind and we go back to, I believe it was the Tamils had their protest. You close -- you compress your footprint. So what happens is I only need to block off two ends of the street, and they’re only on that one street, where when we had that opportunity, and even if it was 500 trucks, and say it was the full length of Wellington, three lanes, but we could have blocked it at Wellington, and maybe out to Bay. And we would have been able to get the vast majority of those people in there. And what happens is, instead of having all those vehicles that were pushed further out, Rideau/Sussex, Sir John A. MacDonald, and other places, they would have been where they wanted to be to get their message out and we would have had -- instead of spreading our resources so thin to manage all those traffic points, because as soon as Rideau/Sussex closed, your traffic point -- traffic perimeter has to be larger to divert people from getting caught at a road block. So it just was a significant draw on resources, and when we didn’t get that opportunity to use PLT to shrink that footprint, we would have reduced it to a smaller size and I wouldn’t have needed all those officers all through the ByWard Market and on Rideau Street, and I could have pivoted them into other proactive engagement activities in the downtown.",09-103-11,103,11,10,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

And the direction that came down was, “We’re not giving them one inch.” So that’s what we worked with. And then again -- so again, we’re spread thing.

09-109-24,"Yeah, so when you look at pre-critical, right, so we have an analyst, or I think we've heard from Intelligence talking about, okay, this is a potential conflict that's coming up; right? So the number one predictor of conflict is real or perceived inequality, so that's something that we look for; right? And when you look at the Province of Ontario right now, you have potentially, you know, roughly 50 land claims up for negotiation. And sometimes -- I remember Inspector Morris saying it's interesting that, you know, PLT sits within IPB, but -- or Indigenous Policing Bureau, sorry, but the reality is, it's extremely important for us to have relationships with Indigenous communities as a result of that number one predictor of conflict. And so in that, what our job is and what the PLT member's job is, is to when they -- when we see that there's going to be potential conflict, our job is to reach out, build relationships. And by relationships, you know, sometimes people just say the word relationship and they don't necessarily break that down. But to us, it actually means something. Like, it means something to build a relationship. So in there, obviously, you need trust. So for me, when I talk about trust, I think it's really important to recognize the person knows that I have their best interests in mind, you know, I'm competent, I'm able to -- and then, ultimately, I do what I say I'm going to do; right? And so we build relationships and then we also get into agreements or ideas of what the protest, demonstration, occupation may look like. So we have those not verbal contracts but pretty much; right? Like, okay, so this is the law. This is what you should avoid doing. This is some alternative options to ensure that it's lawful, peaceful, and safe. And then if there's any deviation from that, here's the potential consequences associated to that. And the reason that we have those up-front conversations is because, typically, emotions and intelligence work as a teeter-totter. So if someone's emotional in times of crisis, typically, intelligence gets low. So when there's no emotion involved, ultimately, it's a great opportunity for us to have conversations that are meaningful and to understand what the objective is, what people are trying to achieve, and how we can facilitate that lawfully, peacefully, safely.",09-109-26,109,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And, you know, sometimes, you know, you have people that don't necessarily get along, and it seems interesting that the police would be such a contributing factor of that, but that's what we're called for is for safety.

09-112-27,"Yeah. There's a lot of similarities, obviously. So when this was created, there was -- it came from the Policing with Indigenous People's Committee for the CACP. And one of the ideas or areas where the Policing with Indigenous Peoples, so I'll call PWIP, just for the sake of time. So we're concentrating on was for, you know, a consistent measured approach to large-scale demonstrations. We recognized that there was demonstrations that happened in British Columbia that had demonstrators at, that happened in Quebec that had the same demonstrators, that happened in Ontario that had the same demonstrators. And, you know, there's no jurisdiction for protest, demonstrations, occupations, but there certainly is for policing, and a consistent, measured approach is obviously something that was a priority to the Policing with Indigenous People's Committee as well as the CACP. And so I was asked to take part in just kind of being one of the people that kind of put this together in 2018. And then with the Policing with Indigenous People's Committee, went through a variety of different steps. So, ultimately, doing an environmental scan, so document review, issue-based review. There was a questionnaire that went out to stakeholders, whether it be people that had been involved from the community at large with demonstrations, protests, or whether it was police officers, people that had been protesting in the past, and police leadership, just to come up with common tenants [sic] or themes that would be a priority to that group, recognizing that we all have to, you know, work together. We live in Canada. We have, you know, Charter of Rights and Freedoms allow people to peacefully demonstrate, right, and to assemble. And, ultimately, Section 1 has limitations to those, but it's something that the police are continually having to deal with in a regular basis; right?",09-112-29,112,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

I think you look at the numbers associated to Provincial Liaison Team in 2012 compared to 2022, and they're tremendously higher as far as the OPP's area goes.

And if we could go down to pages 5 to 6, there's -- there are 7 foundational principles here, and I wonder if, again, in sort of 30 seconds per each, you can just walk us through, and particularly, starting with the measured approach. What is that?",09-114-19,114,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,eric brousseau
09-114-22,"Yeah, the measured approach is probably the most important piece within here. The most important piece for liaison people is relationship building, I would say, in my professional opinion. But when it comes to the measured approach, we're talking about -- and I'll just read it for everyone just because I think it's pretty important; right? Is an, ""...operational philosophy that guides the strategies and tactics of the police in the measures to employ and the prevention of disorder or to achieve timely restoration of order.” This policy emphasizes deliberate employment of proactive engagement, communication, mitigation and facilitation measures while preserving the option to employ a variety of tactical responses as necessary and seeking to respect the lawful exercise of personal rights and freedoms. And so to me, it means it’s almost like the use of force continuum for a major event, right. So we go, we have officer presence, we communicate, communicate, communicate. As things escalate and we’re no longer able to communicate, then obviously there’s tactical responses as necessary that would come in. And it’s kind of on a floating scale, right, like. So it’s not like, okay, negotiations are here, they stop and then Public Order is here and there’s no communication with them. They actually co-exist and there’s pretty quick ability to do both, right. And then -- so when it comes to relationship building, we talk about trust between police and citizens remains essential, ongoing communication, right. And so we look at a few things, so respect, right, rapport, reciprocity, trust. But we spoke just briefly at the beginning about trust. But at the end of the day, it’s a matter of ensuring -- so this is the only unit that really is out there making sure that we are open, transparent and we are -- we are trusted with what we are saying to be true, right. And so it’s so important for us to ensure that these -- you know, these relationships are made a priority, these relationships continue to happen. Like it’s not as if, you know -- so can I fast forward to like something that happened in the Rideau, or no? You just let me know.",09-114-24,114,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

It doesn’t mean neutrality. Neutrality is you don’t have any skin in the game.

09-118-03,"Yeah. So this one’s a -- this one was a big one when it came to the return on questionnaires for people that were involved in protests, wanting education, right, because quite often people will come to a protest and say, “Well, I’m here to protest and this seems to be going on good and I didn’t realize it was unlawful or unpeaceful or unsafe”. And so in the absence of communication, you know, you could have people that are stuck in there recognizing they’re -- you know, that they’re thinking they’re doing something that is okay because it’s been going on or whatever. So one, we do issue and incident based, right. And this is for our police education. So we’ll make sure that our officers are educated on all of that. And then we do -- sorry. Can you scroll it back the other way? And then framework, so just so that everyone knows about the framework itself, and how we work within it and how the measured approach fits, how we try and reduce the footprint, how we -- you know, what we’re trying to achieve and the strategies associated to it and then the culture based if it involves indigenous protests or a variety of different other protests that are out there. And then public education, obviously, to educate the public on lawful, peaceful, safe demonstrations and activity, you know, how injunctions basically work in enforcement activities that the police would be responsible for in that, and then messaging the difference and consequences of being arrested versus being charged because some people will say, “Well, if I got -- if I didn’t get arrested, I’m off, right. I’m good”. But the reality is, is that there might be charges that come as a result of your behaviour even though you -- we may not, as we -- I say we as the police, the police may not be able to deal with that at the time because it’s not safe to do so or there’s a variety of contributing factors as a result.",09-118-05,118,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

09-119-11,Right. And I just want to ask you one further question about the measured approach. You sort of described it as being on a continuum. And how quickly or how much time do you need to kind of work your way from one end of the continuum to the other in the context of a protest?,09-119-13,119,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And what can I say or do to get you to do something that’s lawful, peaceful, safe, right, whether it’s get off the road, get off the rail line, whatever that looks like? And so if someone says, you know, like this is what I’m really trying to achieve and it’s very attainable, then it makes it really easy, right. Like I’ve seen roadblocks where people say, “I want something” that’s very attainable and then it gets done and people leave and everyone’s happy. And it was very -- you know, nothing to it. But then I’ve seen some where people say, “I’m not leaving until something”, you know, unrealistic happens, like Marcel Beaudin has to leave the country and never come back. So if that’s the case, we have nowhere to go with that, right. So if that’s the case, then obviously it’s very easy to work through, right. And really, when there’s that negotiation piece and there’s opportunities, then they should probably be explored.",09-119-19,119,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

09-120-12,"Right. And page 11 has a section on the Role of Liaison Teams. And that’s what we’re talking about when we’re talking about PLT, which is Provincial Liaison Team with the OPP, Public Liaison Team with the OPS, and then the RCMP have their own. DLT for some divisions. But briefly, if you can just describe for us sort of what role liaison teams across police services play in implementing this national framework?",09-120-14,120,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,eric brousseau
09-120-20,"Yeah. So the -- I think the big thing when it comes to liaison teams is really the socialization of them. And sorry, I’m talking with my hands. But you know, the socialization of them. So there’s always been people that try and talk and get things done in a non-structured format, right. Like that’s always been the case. Police have always tried to mediate or negotiate successful, safe outcomes, but this is really to structure them so that you have people that are trained, so people that have an idea of interest-based negotiation, mediation techniques, crowd psychology, so you have experts that can say, okay, if we do this, this and this, potentially, you can end up getting to a successful conclusion. And in the overall idea of the framework itself is really these officers are there to ensure that if there’s a - - a time where Public Order has to come in, there’s the least amount of people there that would potentially cause harm to people, the public, to officers and it becomes as safe as possible, really. So like their job is to -- and you know, if their job is done by saying, “Hey, guys, get off the road” and everyone goes home, that’s amazing. That’s a 10 out of 10, home run. But for the most part, some people want to stay there, exercise their rights to do different things, and so it may take a little bit of time or some people will say -- some people will just stay longer and some people are willing to leave. So it’s important to recognize that, you know, in a -- in a crowd, and I think this is Eli Sopow’s work out of the RCMP. He’s a doctor. And you know, he said in a basic crowd, he was -- you know, a crowd makes up 80 percent is law-abiding, right, and would probably, you know, listen to the police, be manageable, all that stuff. You have 15 percent that are on the fence, and five percent that potentially are criminal in nature, so -- and would be hard to deal with and dig their heels in. And so when you look at that, PLT’s work isn’t to make sure that everyone’s out of there. Like if that happens, that’s great. But our job is to make sure that the 95 percent or those 15 percent don’t swing over and turn into 20, right, because those people are on the fence and it makes the Public Order job much more dangerous and harder. And those 15 percent end up recognising that the police were reasonable, these were reasonable asks, and we end up leaving; right? And so that's really the -- the key function of the PLT is to reduce the footprint so when Public Order ends up going in, if they -- if and when they do, it's the least amount of people that are there, and it sets them up for success. The other thing that it does too, is -- so like when we're asking for a small concession and stuff like that, you're also recognising leadership within the group; right? So you're testing resolve, you're testing compliance, you're testing leadership. Because if someone says, ""I'm the leader of this group"", but they don't have the ability to move anyone, then it certainly -- you can see that right away. You wouldn't want to wait until the last minute to try and get someone to do something, recognising that they don't have any juice in the group to actually move people.",09-120-22,120,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

09-122-24,"Yeah, so PLT logs are created so that that way everyone has a general sentiment of what's going on on the ground, the conversations that are being had between PLT, protesters, protest organisers, the community at large; right? That's a huge component as well; right? So when I talk about the community at large, it's people that aren't directly involved with the protest. So the citizens of Ottawa, businessowners, restaurant owners, people that are around there. And that's such a priority to find out, you know, what's the whole story there, and what are the potential landmines that we'll have to navigate through this? What are potential -- you know, if you concentrate on the community at large and explain things to them and try and work within the community at large as well, then you're less likely to have counterprotests, we'll say, that would potentially, you know, put us back or bring violence to a group, and also put the police in harms way.

Like, so, in the PLT logs you may see, okay, there's still no exit strategy; right? So if you see that, then you know, okay, there's still no plan to leave; right? So what do we have to work on moving forward so that that way there is a plan; right?

I believe it was United We Roll in 2019 that came across with some of the same players; right? So there was already existing relationships from 2019, so it was really easy to just reach out from a PLT perspective or a liaison perspective and ultimately say, ""Okay, I understand you're coming. What's the plan of attack? What do you plan on doing?"", and then if -- and then looking at numbers as they come across. Because I think, you know, normally you can look at Facebook and see there's some numbers that are happening, but in this case, there was a lot more people that were, you know, jumping onto it than Facebook would normally say. So we just had PLT members, a couple of members, going in checking on hotels and different areas as they came across Northwestern Ontario, and then there was areas coming from the south as well, and just kind of giving an idea of what those numbers were, passing them over to Ottawa Police Service, PLT. I think there was a sheet of numbers that basically said ""These are the leaders that we've been working with, talking to. This is what it looks like now."" And I think there was -- I shouldn't say this, but I believe that there was a meeting even set up where people ended up going out to Russell parking lot and meeting with some of the leaders of the convoy from OPS as a result of the PLT work. So that was kind of it, like setting up the scene. And then in those -- like, as we were learning stuff in Northwest Region about how the convoy worked, as we were learning stuff from the West Region, we were sharing that with our policing partners as they were coming into their areas, as well as sharing it with OPS.

Like I help facilitate a CACP policing with Indigenous peoples course for large scale protests, which is a liaison course; right? And I would say probably there was 20 members on there. I would say that the OPS PLT members were very driven, they had unbelievable characteristics when you look at what we're trying to look for when it comes to a PLT member. So in 2019, I sat as the Acting or Interim Commander for Emergency Response, so I oversaw a true ERT, canine, tactical, paramedics program and explosive disposal, and in there, like there's a lot of men. And I was asked by a doctor to say, ""You know, what are some barriers impacting women and policing?"" And I didn't make the connection, but they said, ""Well, in here there's hardly any women and in PLT there's lots of women."" And I said it's really a value system. And when I looked at the OPS members, they were really following the same value system. They were community- focussed, they were compassionate, they were empathetic, they were unbelievable communicators. They were everything that you would want in someone to represent an organisation in a time of crisis. I thought that they were really well-chosen.",09-127-13,127,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,ACTING SUPT. MARCEL BEAUDIN,acting supt. marcel beaudin
09-128-05,"Okay. Now, I understand you arrived in Ottawa, I think it was February 2nd, so sort of after the first weekend of demonstrations and protests.

09-128-10,"So I believe I arrived on the 3rd. On the 2nd I was engaged in a conversation with Superintendent Mark Patterson surrounding the PLT logs and their use for evidence for an injunction. And to me, I didn't think that that was a good use of PLT logs, and it would obviously, potentially damage relationships that are out there too, because there's always this thing where people, you know -- there's this thing where people think that potentially we're spying on them, and that's not the case. We're there to make things safer, and we have a long road to go. And I definitely didn't want it to look like we were spying on people, right, because that's not our job. And so I just -- I cautioned him as to the use of the PLT logs, and he said that he wouldn't use them. And then as I was talking to him, I recognized that they didn't necessarily have a good understanding of what PLT did. We went through what PLT does, how they do it, what are some strategies, whatever, and he was very thankful for the conversation, and he was an absolute gentleman at that time as well. And so but on that it just showed me that maybe we needed to assist with some leadership there for PLT, and I was also getting grumblings from our membership saying, you know, things just aren't going as well as they probably could. So on the third, I had said to our command, you know, is this something that would be beneficial having someone in leadership over there to help support that, and they agreed to that. The unfortunate part is I -- in my mind I thought just Gisselle Walker was going, who was the PLT Provincial Coordinator, but she had a province to take care of, and so I ended up coming. So inadvertently volunteered myself for that.",09-128-12,128,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,ACTING SUPT. MARCEL BEAUDIN,acting supt. marcel beaudin

09-129-15,"Yes, so -- yeah, so when I got to Ottawa, there was a couple key pieces of real estate that had been identified to get back. One of them was Confederation Park. The PLT in Ottawa as well as OPP had great relationships with the Algonquin leadership here as well as the Algonquin leadership in Kitigan Zibi. And, ultimately, they had reached out to try and mediate or negotiate a safe exit of that park. And I believe that was on the 4th of February that the leaders and leadership and elders and community members ended up coming down. And they ended up meeting for a long time. On the 5th of February was an unbelievable day for me. It was a day of great pride and the encampment actually cleared out as a result of those negotiations. It took a little bit of time, some nudging in the afternoon, but ultimately, the camp ended up clearing on the 5th as a result of that.",09-129-17,129,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

09-130-08,"We've heard a lot of evidence on it, so, you know, we don't need to go through sort of -- through it in detail, but from a PLT perspective, what can you tell us about what transpired and why that might have been an issue?",09-130-10,130,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,eric brousseau
09-130-13,"Yeah. So ultimately, in the morning, I believe, of the 6th, there was 2 priorities, I believe, for Superintendent Patterson who was the new Incident Commander as of the 5th evening, I believe. And so on the 6th, there was 2 priorities. One was Rideau and Sussex, the other one was Coventry Road. And so the idea was to do some sort of public order hit on Rideau and Sussex and then potentially Coventry Road afterwards. And then as the day unfolded, the messaging turned into we weren't doing Rideau and Sussex anymore, and it was a matter of go to Coventry Road, tell them that they have to leave without -- or get out of there, take all the gas with them or they're going to be arrested. And I know there was some concern when it talks to tough messaging. Like, I know my one sergeant reached out and said, ""You know, it's going to be tough because we don't really have rapport there."" Well, at the end of the day, it doesn't -- like, that doesn't matter if you have rapport for that. This is just messaging to get them out of there, so that that way, we establish the strategy of what's to go on. And then ultimately, if they don't, then they know we've educated them before the enforcement; right? And then so while that was going on, I ended up getting back, and someone had said to me in the Command -- not in the Command Post. It was, like, a tactical planning area for Public Order people. I think it was Mike Stoll, who was a Staff Sergeant at the time. And he had said to me, ""You know that there they're going to do a Public Order hit on Rideau and Sussex"", which I never did, and I think Diana Hampson called me at the exact same time and told me -- or around that time and said that they were going to do that and that would be problematic. And so, you know, I'd reached out to Mark Patterson and told him the consequences associated to that, because, again, when you look at PLT, there is one unit that's built for open, honest, transparent lines of communication; right? And so we have just told them if you don't leave, you're going to be arrested. And then what ended up happening was going to be they were going to be arrested anyway. And so to me, I thought, one, that would damage PLT in the City of Ottawa; right? Like, you would have -- because here's a place that I believe was supplying gasoline for a bunch of people or diesel for a bunch of people. So you're going to damage PLT or the efficiency of PLT as being trusting. And then also, you're going to damage relationships with all the other trucker convoy leadership, right, because they're probably connected with everyone. And the next time we say you better leave or you're going to get arrested, I would probably imagine there would be some doubt associated to that. So if someone heard PLT in the future say, hey, if you don't leave you're going to be arrested, like, my concern would be, okay, well, I'm staying because I know I'm getting arrested anyway; right? Like, that was my biggest concern there. The relationships were something different, but the big thing was to ensure that we remained with that trust and confidence in what our role was there. And, ultimately, I think he said to me that's not fair. And I thought that that was a really interesting response to something that when we're talking about tactics or strategy or an operation that that's not fair, because that seems to certainly personalize it. But anyway, they ended up doing it, and I had then sent him -- I had called him, said, ""You know, I didn't realize that that was such a big thing as far as the gas."" And I said, ""You know, obviously, this was a miscommunication. My captain is going to come in and replace me,"" because he was replacing me that afternoon and I was going back home to Orillia. But because of this stuff, I ended up staying around. And ultimately, on my departure -- or in that conversation, I said I would send him an email that would probably help him out just with some structure with five points on it that you should consider and it's probably some pretty sage advice. And then I sent that email and went about my day just trying to clean up the emotion that was attached to it. There was some people that had some pretty hard feelings, they're emotionally invested. I ended up sending basically one person home, talked to another person, nothing was salvageable that night. So I said, ""Go home, rest and get ready to work tomorrow morning.""",09-130-15,130,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,ACTING SUPT.

But leading into it, there was a lot of people that wanted to work with police in how to -- you know, how to -- how could we safely reduce the footprint, easing some tension from the City of Ottawa, while recognizing, you know, that we have to put the Public Order people in a successful position to potentially at some point take down an occupation within Ottawa.",09-133-23,133,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

09-134-08,"You mentioned earlier part of the concept of PLT is you will test leadership and find the leaders and get them to assist you in disseminating messages. One thing we’ve heard is that there were -- you know, that was maybe a challenge here. There were multiple groups, no clear leaders who had control over the entire protest, obviously. You know, is that something that PLT observed and how did you deal with that?",09-134-10,134,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,eric brousseau
09-134-17,"Yeah. And so I -- you know, the unfortunate part was, there wasn’t a pile of really strong testing of leadership and resolve and compliance. You know, I think you have two relatively large events that end up happening when it comes to Confederation Park, which you tested leadership and resolve there and compliance, to which people -- someone obviously had the leadership and compliance to move a crowd of people out of Confederation Park. You have Coventry Road where some people are leaving. I don’t know the exact details of all of the stuff that happened there outside of the emotion. But that day, like that afternoon, I walked into the PLT office to introduce Mike Acton to people because he would be replacing me and have a little meeting there. And you know, in that meeting with those guys, I was -- I walked in and I was shocked because there was all PLT people in there. And to me, PLT people in a time of crisis should never be sitting in a room together, right. Like there’s enough people to go and talk to, there’s enough opportunities for negotiation, there’s enough opportunities and, really, what I saw was a bunch of wasted opportunities in that room. So I said, “Like why are you guys here?”. And they said they hadn’t had any direction or any permission to go and do anything right outside the Coventry Road. And so I said, “Okay. So if you guys were let loose, like if you guys were unhandcuffed and able to go out and do your work, what could you do?”. And you know, I don’t know the exact numbers, but the one gentleman who’s an OPS member says, “I could probably clear Rideau and Sussex by Monday or Tuesday”. And then another guy says, “I can take care of this many people. I could probably get this many people to leave”. I could probably open up a roadway, but we’d have to move them to a curbway. I could probably do this. And so that was a common theme around that room, and so I ended up reaching -- and you know, like we’re in middle management, right. So there’s an Incident Commander. I reached over to John Ferguson and I say to John, “So like you’re the Staff Sergeant here”. And John’s, you know, been put into a really tough spot, right. Like John’s not a PLT trained member. He’s a crisis negotiator. And he’s an absolute gentleman, too. And so I said to John, “Like so you’re middle management. You’re in charge here. You’re hearing all this. What are your thoughts? Do you think that this can be done?”, whatever, because really, John’s in charge of that team, right. Like I’m there for guidance, advice, suggestions, learned experience over -- you know, since 2016 to current, and then 2005 I was dealing with protestor civil unrest, and so I had that to draw on. And so I was trying to get John to give me his opinion on it and he was saying, “Yeah. You know, I think this is really good”. So we tried to call Mark Patterson, tried to Mike Stoll because I thought they were together, and there was no answer. And so in the absence of any direction, I said, “How safe do you feel letting these people go?”. And he said, “I feel good about it”. And then we got into the other room and then he didn’t feel good about it. And you know, good on him, right, like, because, really, they needed to have -- ensure that it met with the strategic direction of OPS Command, but there was just so many opportunities that were there that were unexplored. So when you talk about, you know, testing compliance, resolve, whatever, you know, we had very minimal opportunity to do that, I would submit.",09-134-19,134,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

But before I do that, I just want to asak you one quick question. At one point you raised or someone on your team kind of raised a concern about the role that someone named Dr. Peter Collins was playing in Ottawa. Can you just tell us who Peter Collins or Dr. Peter Collins is and what his role was and what the concern was?",09-138-07,138,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU (cont’d),MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,eric brousseau
09-138-14,"Yeah, Dr. Peter Collins is a psychologist that works with police forces across the province. He typically deals with crisis negotiation, is my understanding. He's a great guy and a tremendous asset for policing in a crisis negotiation setting. And there was one meeting that I happened to be in where he had said in the presence of Chief Sloly and some other senior level members in the -- for OPS, and I happened to be virtually just in the room, in this planning room, and he had said something about to the effects, and I think it -- you know, we had talked about it afterwards and he said it was a bit of a misunderstanding, but he said, ""The PLT had taken it as far as it can go and really moving forward we need a negotiation aspect to this."" And this was like February 4th, maybe, February 5th, like around that time; right? And to my understanding at that time, from the members on ground, was PLT hadn't been utilised appropriately to date and there wasn't any, you know, as far as an integrated command structure there was no integration to date. And the other thing that the other thing that was mentioned was PLT would gather intelligence for this negotiation team. And so when PLT isn't gathering intelligence, one, that's fundamentally against the role of PLT is; and two, it provides me a -- you know, an overview of a general lack of understanding of what the role of PLT actually does. And so for me, it wasn't necessarily -- like I liked the idea of having Peter Collins engaged and involved and all that stuff, for me it was a matter of kind of a scope of practice issue as well as a confusion issue when it comes to okay, who's dictating what a negotiation looks like with a crowd, because there's certain fundamental crowd psychology principles that you would typically manage, and I'm not saying that I know more than Peter Colins, but there's some proven methods in policing that work, and I just don't know if, you know, that's the right avenue when you haven't explored options yet.",09-138-16,138,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

We had a public order on the way and it was time to identify the people that it -- there’s going to be a movement coming; it’s coming soon; and we would be highly criticized, I think, if we didn’t allow people to get out of the city, right, to get -- to leave, to pick up their stuff and go and really reduce that footprint. So, for me, it was extremely important, as well as Gisele and the rest of the team, to ensure that we were providing the most clear, accurate information as possible to ensure that people were on their way out.",09-164-25,164,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

09-166-02,"Yeah, so one was protests for senior command, and ours included. And there’s no criticism whatsoever on anyone in this. It was a unbelievable event but I’d found that, you know, there was a lack of understanding where we separated liaison work from public order work. When I was on the Hostage Rescue Team, we had negotiators on the Hostage Rescue Team because it’s vitally important to create opportunities where you can resolve stuff with communication. And so in this, it was ultimately an opportunity to say, “Okay, guys, we should probably take a look at streamlining the measured approach, socializing it, and policing as an actual something that we do, so that that way we can get to the bottom of stuff quicker."" And like, so you look at some of the stuff that happened on February 6th, right? So there was a PLT request for Rideau and Sussex, right, so we were going to go and -- or we, the police, were going to go with public order unit potentially and go and remove people from Rideau and Sussex. I expedited an email to Mark Patterson to say, ""If it was me and this was going to happen, this is how you should use PLT right now,"" right? So a communication strategy built in to stuff so that people are aware that they can leave and that we're not just running in there putting people in harm's way. And so for this, there's opportunities where we could do a better job as senior management or senior commanders in policing on a national level to better understand the measured approach and how it can impact outcomes for the better. And then the second one was, I look at the CACP policing with Indigenous People's Committee and you know, there's John Brewer, who's the Chief Superintendent that sits on that with tactical background. I'm not sure the tactical background of everyone that’s on there. We have an emergency management committee, which Mike Nelson, I think, co-chairs or chairs and sits on. And so you have all these merging CACP commands. And maybe it's time to look at okay, this is a relatively big event. I would say it's a huge event, right? It impacted this -- our Nation's Capital. And protests have just got bigger and bigger and bigger in the last few years, right? Like, I focus on 2012 with Idle No More, right, and some of the stuff there. I think there was, you know, roughly 200 peaceful protests in the Province of Ontario in 2012. And then in 2020 we had, you know, multiple, 200 type events in the province, and then we had the largest display of public order in the history of the nation in 2022, and there's no slowing down.

What the issue was, is was a miscommunication of we're not going to arrest you if you leave with fuel, and then we're going to arrest you when you leave with the fuel. That was the concern for me.

It allows the Incident Commander to have decision-making information, whether we have to do an assessment through an NRA process, is it necessary, risk-effective, acceptable, that it could be all captured.

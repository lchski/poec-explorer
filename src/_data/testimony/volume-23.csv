Commissioner, yesterday at the close of the proceeding, a matter was raised by Mr. Miller about the state of documents on the party database, and in light of those comments, Commission Counsel investigated the matter last night. And most of the parties will have received and had a chance to review Commission Counsel's email to them explaining what we've been able to learn about that situation, and so I won't elaborate on that, except to say that, two things: We did recognise that there had been a glitch with respect to the uploading of documents, and that was corrected over the weekend. It was unfortunate, but the matter is in hand and the party database is in good form. The other thing we'd like to assure parties, Mr. Commissioner, is that Commission Counsel did have access to all of the documents, and indeed, the parties will notice that the documents, including those that just went up on the party database over the weekend, that some of which are included in our list of documents for the examination of this panel, and so we are prepared to proceed confident that we have had a thorough review of the documents in advance of this panel appearing.",23-007-19,7,19,18,speaker_start,NA,MR.

So the way I'll put it is this: that you have reviewed -- each of you two have reviewed the summary and confirm that insofar as it contains your information you believe it to be true and accurate to the best of your knowledge and belief, and that insofar as it contains the information of your colleagues, you understand it to have been reviewed by them for accuracy and confirmed as accurate.

In relation to the convoys, obviously, we had convoys across the country, so I was getting operational updates in our jurisdiction. When it came to the specific convoy in -- or the protests in Ottawa, there was a few roles I had. One was to -- I was liaising with Chief Sloly on a couple of occasions, relaying resource asks that we received. If I was in receipt of those resource asks, I would pass that down through our command structure. It was also one of the major responsibilities was to get the information from across the country and to brief the Deputy Minister community, the Ministers, there was four Ministers that we would -- that I would brief. And then halfway through, the Prime Minister called Incident Response Group where I would brief situational reports from across the country of anything that was happening related to the convoy. And generally speaking, I had to make sure that in our police of jurisdiction that our divisions had the resources, ensuring that they had the resources, the equipment that they needed to deal with those incidents.",23-012-29,12,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

We are also responsible at the border between the ports of entry, and we also have a protective policing mandate, which ensures protection to certain incoming dignitaries or the Prime Minister, Chief Justice, the Governor General and others that are appointed by the Minister. And they also have our intelligence in international policing that reports into federal policing. So my role on the convoy from the onset really, we were looking at it through a lens of protective policing. That was our -- so that was our core mandate when it all started. As the resources ask started and this -- as this grew, the Commissioner appointed me to be the point person for the organization to coordinate the assistance that were provided to OPS throughout. I was part of the gold command structure when it was formed. My responsibility throughout from the beginning was to ensure that the Commissioner had the right information to brief up at the various briefings at the DM level, at the Ministerial level at the ERC and the coordination of resources from across the country that needed to be brought in, I had a team looking after that.

We also have -- within that protective, we also have an intel unit that feeds in to prepare -- to better prepare our posture and respond to any incidents.

Coordinating routes to get into the area.

Now, we’re not going to spend a lot of time on that, and Commissioner, this is the point where I would footnote, so to speak, the witness summary that I referenced at the very beginning because Commission Counsel did do an interview and filed the interview summary of Ms. Ducharme and Ms. Vignette specifically on this point of the RCMP’s collection of intelligence in relation to the convoy, so we’ll just ask this panel a few questions about this.

23-021-05,"Yeah, there’s several structures in place when it came to intel within the organization. So we had ideologically motivated criminal intelligence team that were looking at it more from a national scope as to what was going on and providing strategic threat advisory bulletins; I think there’s eight in total that went out throughout the legal protests. And we also had our Protective Intelligence Unit that was really gathering intelligence to help us with our protective posture, but it doesn’t neglect the fact that the information gathered, and under the PIU Unit would be shared with other agencies. And eventually, early on, I think it was on the 28th or the 29th, pardon me, we did create what is known as a Combined Intelligence Group that would bring together people from different law enforcement organizations within the Ottawa area, such as you’d have OPS, OPP, Sureté du Québec, Service de police de la ville de Gatineau, that would be present and that’s meant to bring to a hub together so that everybody can share the information that they have. Because it’s not just the RCMP working on a block of information; every organization’s working on the information and it’s coordinated through that Combined Intelligence Group. As this grew and there’s more and more increase resources being brought in, we stood up -- at the National Headquarters, we stood up another combined group really to coordinate the intel from a national perspective so that we could prepare the Commissioner with a picture of what’s going across the country. I’ll factor that in too, you’ve heard the Hendon report several times, that was a report from the OPP that was also used to help the CIG, the Combined Intelligence Group, in the analysis of all the intel that’s coming in.

And then again, under a different subsection of Article 9, we can request up to 10 percent of resources in any other province. And so what we do is we normally -- if it’s urgent matter, we move the resources and then ask for permission later, because we’ll never compromise the safety of Canadians.

We’ve heard about their federal policing role and their protective services mandate, but I’d like to take you back a bit in history and ask you if you can -- well let’s start way back, so to speak. Has the RCMP, at least in our living memory, ever been a city police? The police of jurisdiction in Ottawa?",23-026-09,26,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR.

23-026-22,"Okay. But there was a time that you’ve outlined in your summary, your witness interview summary, when there was a more substantial contingent of what you might call uniformed officers on the ground in Ottawa. Can you explain when that was and what the purpose of those forces were?",23-026-24,26,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
23-026-28,"Yeah, and that’s correct. The RCMP did have a larger footprint in the Ottawa region in the year 2000s leading up to 2014, after the attacks on Parliament Hill. There was a review that was done. And I should just say that prior to that, the organization, the RCMP was responsible for the security of Parliament Hill, outside component of House of Commons and Senate, not the interior. The interior was managed by -- House of Commons had their own security, Senate had their own, and the RCMP was responsible for the outside grounds. At that time also, we had more resources. When it came to our protective policing mandate, we had more clients to protect at the time, and then over years, there’s a different approach on the way we did business that reduced actually our footprint when it came to protective policing, as well as patrols of the embassies. Back to the -- our responsibility on the Hill, we had an excess of 120 people there that were assigned to the Hill on a permanent basis to ensure the security. When the attacks occurred, there was a review done of the entire security posture on the Hill, and that’s when a new legislation was created to create the Parliamentary Protective Service, who the RCMP was responsible leading the integration of security of different units that were there. What we saw after a year and a half being there, it was decided to put a plan forward that realizing that the job that’s being performed on Parliament Hill was not a policing function, but more security function, there’s a transition that was done with PPS with the accord of the both speakers to reduce the footprint of the RCMP. Currently, legislatively, the only position that requires an RCMP member is the position of director. So when you talk about shift, and resources, and footprint, there’s a significant one that happened recently. Protective Policing, when it came to our clients, happened before that. So if I may, when you look at the dynamics prior to this change, the RCMP, when it was responsible for the Hill, looked after all the planning of the different events that took place on the Hill. This is prior to the creation of PPS. And we would work jointly with Ottawa Police Service, being a demo that’s going through the streets of Ottawa and would land on Parliament Hill, then it becomes -- it’s shifted over from OPS to us, and we worked jointly on that, in regards with the plans, the preparation, to respond to any demos that are going on Hill. When PPS came in to effect, I was the first director, and what we were looking at is the PPS becomes distinct and basically not separate from the RCMP, because the RCMP still had a role to play, but must be distinct. So the planning was now done from PPS. Since 2015, every event that was done on the Hill was being done from PPS, and not necessarily RCMP. We assisted in the beginning, but now they’re completely autonomous when they’re planning for events on the Hill.",23-026-30,26,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,D/COMM.

But on a day-to-day basis, yes, there's liaison going on with OPS, with the Ottawa Police Service, but it's more -- there's liaison going on, but less of a reliance to rely on OPS on a daily basis, but it's only when events are in the area that's when we come together, NCRCC, and make sure that everybody is informed so that we can properly plan.

Early discussions I had with OPS on the matter, there seems to be no concerns whatsoever, good relationships with the organiser, organisers, and there was no need for us to question the relationship they had with them.

But I do want to spend some time on the question of the requests by the OPS for assistance and resources to be provided by the RCMP. I'll begin by just asking you to describe, this is probably for you, Commissioner Lucki, the logistical challenges and perhaps administrative challenges that the RCMP faces when it, well, I suppose some of these apply even when you're moving within provinces that you have contracts with, but in all events, the logistical challenges that you had when attempting to mobilise resources to assist in Ottawa, or otherwise, in Ontario?",23-031-25,31,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
23-032-09,"Well, first and foremost in the requests, they weren't requests for plainclothes officers, which is what we primarily do in -- within Quebec and Ontario. We -- obviously they're police officers, so they have uniforms, they don't work in those uniforms each and every day, so when we make requests for the federal resources in a uniformed capacity that's changing their role, their primary role. Within the two provinces, it's a lot easier that outside of the provinces only because we have control of the federal resources, but also because they can drive into Ottawa. But they don't come in a big chunk, so when we need additional resources we fan that out from Deputy Commissioner Duheme to the commanding officer of Ontario and Quebec requesting additional resources, and then they do their -- what they need to do to get those resources, and they will come individually, or you know, driving however they get there. When we're doing the same thing nationally, of course we have to request the -- under the PPSA, the Article 9, and then we get into way more logistics in the sense of flying them out, are there going to be vehicles available, what kind of shifting are they going to do, what types of resources do you need. Because in -- especially in the contract policing environment, we have a multitude of different types of resources within the uniform capacity. So it's -- we need to know what kind of resources and how long they'll be gone. Because when we take resources out of the contract side of the house they have to be backfilled somewhere else because policing goes on. So we have to make sure that all of those logistics are done at that level.",23-032-11,32,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,COMM BRENDA LUCKI,comm. brenda lucki
23-033-10,"Can I add to that? An important factor that we have to remember is that requesting resources, be it from Quebec or Ontario, the RCMP still has a mandate to fulfill in those provinces, and mobilising resources, you have to find the resources. We have ongoing investigations that we cannot stop, so it's finding that right balance of how many resources can we release to make sure keep the lights on to ensure that we are still on mandate of what we're doing in the respective provinces. So it's not just -- it's easy to say we need 50 additional people, but then we have to look at who is releasable in the divisions based on the functions of the responsibilities that they're -- that they have right now.

23-036-20,"Well, I’ll start and then I’ll pass it over to D/Commissioner Duheme.

So their numbers even -- they were swearing in certain numbers. Those numbers might have not all been deployed at that time of the swearing in. Also, the fact that there was requests and some of it was -- there was confusions over is it so many per shift or is it a total number. But from the tactical or from the -- you know, the bronze level of our command that we were talking about, we were advised that any of the requests that they had for frontline -- when I talk about frontline resources -- we fulfilled those requests. And I think there was a confusion between what the Mayor may have been reporting and what the Chief may have been reporting, but we were advised at the tactical level that any time they needed resources because that’s where they get into what kind of resource, where are they going to be placed, what shift are they going to be working.

23-038-26,"At that point when there was a request for 1,800 resources -- and obviously, I was in consultation with the OPP Commissioner. And it tells what kind of officers, but it wasn’t is it 1,800 RCMP, is it -- you know, because there was still the OPP who were responsible for securing resources from all the various municipalities. We were under the impression that it was 1,800 between all of us, and what did that mean, who was going to provide what resource. And when we get into these high numbers, that’s when we have to ask, okay, what is the plan. What -- where’s your plan, how are you going to rotate these resources, what kind of resources specifically? And it sort of talks about that, but 100 civilian staff, what does that mean? There’s all kinds of duties under civilian staff. The Public Order officers, 600. We don’t -- you know, to have 600 Public Order officers, the OPP was actually responsible for the prioritizing of Public Order officers within the province of Ontario during that time. Did that mean they were going to provide the Public Order, we were going to provide front? So until we saw what the plan was because the minute we draw outside of Ontario and Quebec, we have responsibilities to our contracts. We have to know when we draw them out how long are they going to be gone, when are they going to be replaced, how are they going to get there, what are the logistics. Is there equipment that they can’t bring with them that they need when they land like certain vehicles or command centres in the -- in the case of Public Order? If they are going to drive their command post, then they need lead time. So there’s lots of things to consider. A general request like this, it sort of, in a way, caught us off guard because we didn’t have those discussions with Chief Sloly up to that time.

This was, you know, assistance to a neighbouring police service and we provided that. And even subsequent requests wasn't going through that. But when it got to this number, that's when the OPP Commissioner explained to me the process, of which I wasn't aware of, that such requests should go through the OPP, and then the OPP would exhaust all avenues within the province of Ontario, and if required, would come to outside -- you know, they could go to, like, another municipality, like, Edmonton City Police or a different police services, or they can go to the RCMP.

This is operational decisions, and we make those operational decisions based on our availability of resources, our ability to deploy such resources. If in fact, like, obviously, this was -- the last example you gave, this was a letter from the mayor to the Minister. He would pass the letter on to us and say, ""Here's a request."" And he would never say fulfil this request. He would say, ""See what -- you know, here's the request. Deal with it what you can do,"" depending on the numbers, because we may not have the numbers available to be able to do that. And that's why we were surprised, because it never usually goes to that level. It usually just goes, you know, from police service to police service. If they require assistance, they would come through our police service. We would fulfil it when we -- as best as we can. Because in this particular convoy, our goal was to assist Ottawa Police Service as much as we can -- we could, so that they could be successful in putting an end to the protest. As far as the -- any of the operational decisions, the government isn't involved with that and it's just more of an information where we provided -- you know, we're providing additional resources to Ottawa Police Service.

So there was a bit of education on that in saying, of course, when people are looking at solutions, one of the solutions was, well why doesn’t the RCMP take over? We got asked that quite often. We’d say, “Well, it’s not our -- we’re not the police of jurisdiction. We don’t have jurisdiction in the Province of Ontario. There’s a lot of other layers before coming -- you would never come to the RCMP. That’s not our role.” But I think there was an assumption, because we’re the federal policing or national policing agency in Canada, there was an assumption that that’s what that meant. And so we were trying to educate Deputy Ministers and Ministers that, you know, our role is not to overtake any police agency.

Within our own organization, especially on the gold, silver, bronze, when they all came together, everybody was rolling up their sleeves trying to figure out, “How are we going to end this?” And how are we -- you know, “How are going to deal with?” So we were putting a lot of pressure on ourselves, from an organizational point of view.

And they -- despite -- even at the final days of enforcement, Ottawa Police Service had the lead in that, and that was very, very important, that they -- there always has to be somebody who is taking the lead, and it’s the police of jurisdiction.",23-056-17,56,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

So my question to you is, where does the RCMP look for guidance on where that line is? And I’m just going to insert, parenthetically, we’ve had a lot of information about how the Ottawa Police Service has, between it and the City Council, the Ottawa Police Services Board, and the same will be true of other police of jurisdiction of various places. We don’t see the same between you, the RCMP, and either the senior officials or the politicians.

23-057-13,"Well for me, it’s pretty clear. Anything operational, we’re advising what’s happening, but we’re not taking direction on how to do things. And we’ve never been provided direction on how -- what we should do. And it was actually interesting, I think, in one of the meetings, because normally when I brief, I brief generally speaking, the Minister of Public Safety, and sometimes now that they’ve split, the Minister of Emergency Preparedness. In this case, there was additional Ministers. So I think it was maybe the first IRG, or maybe even the First Minister meeting, where I believe it was Minister Mendicino advising these Ministers that, “You are not to provide direction to the Commissioner.” They remind themselves. My Ministers don’t need to remind themselves, because we deal with them on a daily basis, or regular basis, but with the new Ministers, there was even just a reminder, because sometimes what happens is when you’re into problem solving, problem solving can sometimes translate into, you know, “We should do this and we should do that. Could we do this and could we do that?” And sometimes that -- people might feel that that’s direction. I don’t consider any of that direction. Direction to me is something that you specifically would turn to me and say, “Commissioner, we need you to do this,” or, “Don’t do this.” That’s direction. That’s interference.

So I took it when this was briefed to me the first time, the 1800 police officer or 1,000 police officers, 600 Public Order Teams, 100 support staff, I took it that is that what they're asking, considering that Deputy Chief Steve Bell says he's asking to double what he needs.

And so I believe that Deputy Minister Rob Stewart was tasked with looking into the possibility of having a -- an official speak with the protesters. And he wanted to know how that works with the liaison teams and how they -- what they're doing as far as negotiations with the protesters. Because we weren't involved with all of that, I reached out to Tom Carrique, and Tom Carrique advised me that it was in fact the OPP Police Liaison Team that was leading the negotiations with the protesters, and so I asked if I could connect the lead -- who the lead was of that team and if I could connect them with Deputy Minister Rob Stewart so he could get more information. And really, my role as a facilitator, and I introduced the two of them so they could talk. Later on, he was coming up with this protest engagement strategy. I think he asked, you know, what we thought of it. I sent it back to my team who deals with liaising. We have a different structure but the same idea but different structure. I gave it to them to say is there any red flags on these documents or is there any advice we can provide Deputy Minister Stewart. I think we provided him a bit of advice on that. I think as well I included asking Inspector Beaudin what he thought of what I had said, but then I had already realised that he had reviewed the document I think, so it was just a matter of connecting Deputy Minister Stewart with Inspector Beaudin on this protest engagement strategy as one of his tasks.",23-067-05,67,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Your update to Cabinet, as it is deciding whether to invoke the Emergencies Act, is that the police now have a plan. They've pulled it together. And that you, as the Commissioner of the RCMP, consider that plan to be workable without the authorities of the Emergencies Act, and that doesn't get delivered, your messages don't get delivered to Cabinet when they then deliberate on the invocation of the Act.

But, yes, in fact, the fact that we now had a plan, I'm not sure if it was signed off either as of that point because we were having difficulty getting it signed off. We didn't realize it needed to be signed off. But I know that on that same day, like, we -- I think it was the Sunday that would have been, I'm guessing, the -- that was the 13th.

So acknowledging that there might have been some less precise messaging to the officials and to government before the meeting where you didn't get called, nonetheless, you appreciated the significance of those meetings that were taking place on the 13th and you appreciated the significance, I assume, of the fact that you hadn't got a chance to give those key messages that we've looked at before.

Honestly, there was so much information going back and forth, I'm not sure, you know, where they were at in the invocation as such. I know they were talking about it, but it was very, very fluid. Obviously, I'm not sure if it would have changed anything in the sense that these were -- even, like, now, I'm going to use my hindsight, the plan ended up -- those authorities ended up to be useful with the plan, if I use my hindsight, because it wasn't whether or not we'd have -- we were still -- we would have still been looking at enforcement, but we needed ways to reduce the footprint. So we were using some of the authorities obviously under the Ontario Emergency Act. We weren't incorporating anything on the Federal Emergency Act because it wasn't in place. But we didn't have when exactly the plan was going to start, or we knew it had to be starting in the weekdays as opposed to the weekends, so now the plan was in place and the implementation would have been the next exact when we were going to implement it.",23-089-12,89,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

23-090-27,"Perfect. Thank you. Now, Clerk, if you could scroll down on this a little bit, there's a series of emails by which -- there, we can stop there. This is sort of -- Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner, I don't expect you to have seen this email other than you might have in the course of preparing for this hearing. That is, I don't expect you to have seen it at the time perhaps, but just to set up what is going to come at you so you can understand the context, this is an email from Jody Thomas, and we all know that she's the National Security Intelligence Advisor to the Prime Minister. And it is February 14th, and I don't know if that's a reliable email timestamp, but if -- assuming it's just a normal email timestamp, it's about midday on the 14th. And that's probably going to put us somewhere just after the first Minister's meeting or just before, anyway, right in the context of that event on the 14th. And we have Jody Thomas saying, and I'll just read it out, so that it's on the record. She is writing to Mike MacDonald, and we'll learn later on who he is, but he's another person in the PCO Intelligence apparatus, and he's copied Rob Stewart who we say yesterday as the Deputy Minister of Public Safety. And Ms. Thomas says, ""This is about a national threat to national interest and institutions. By people who do not care about or understand democracy. [We are preparing to be violent -- sorry,] who are preparing to be violent. Who are motivated by anti government sentiment."" And can you scroll down to the -- a little further, Mr. Clerk, on that? And then, again, we're all going to have to be a little bit detectives figuring out what's going on with these emails because this is a sort of orphan email from Jody Thomas, not obviously to anybody, but is attached to the one that we just looked at, where she says, ""I need an assessment for Janice..."" And I'll just ask you to speculate with me that that's Janice Charette, the clerk for the Privy Council. ""...about the threat of these blockades. The characters involved. The weapons. The motivation. Clearly this isn’t just COVID and is a threat to democracy and rule of law. Could I get an assessment please. David is this you? It [is] a very short fuse. Please call if you have [any] questions J” Now, again, you’re perhaps wondering why I’m reading you emails that aren’t to you or from you. But what we’ll see, and this will be the next email, is that the request for an assessment gets directed to Adriana Poloz, which was why we talked about her. On that point, could I ask the Clerk to pull up PB.NSC.CAN.00003462? Okay. And just to get the sequence correct, let’s go down to the bottom of this, or least to there. If I’m understanding correctly, and maybe, Mr. Duheme, since you ended up getting copied in here, you would be able to help us with this? It looks like the request from Jody Thomas got directed by some means, perhaps, by Mr. MacDonald, or perhaps by you. If you could help us with that? Got somehow directed to Adriana Poloz.

23-093-13,Correct. And they were probably looking for additional information because the Strategic Threat Advisory Reports that were being shared with government were also being shared for PCO.

23-093-24,"Yeah. And then again, Ms. Poloz writing back to Mr. MacDonald, gives an assessment, and we’re not going to read through the whole thing, but Mr. Clerk, maybe you could just scroll slowly down so the audience can get a gist of what’s in there, as I say? We don’t really have time to read the whole thing. The document is available to parties if they want to look at it in more detail. But it’s a description -- we see a reference to Three Percenters, to Diagolon, to Canada First, et cetera, to various movements or individuals that could be implicated in national security matters, and then a reference to IMVE groups, and then finally, in the penultimate paragraph there, reference to blockades at the international borders. So let me ask the sort of chain of command or institutional flow question here to either of you, Commissioner, or Deputy Commissioner.

23-094-26,"Right. And -- but the point about briefing you is the one that intrigues me. This wasn’t just a request for a threat assessment by somebody who happened to know somebody in your department. As I think everybody understood at this stage, the NSIA was giving advice to the government on the invocation of the Emergency Act for the first time it had ever been invoked, and that threat assessment goes straight past everybody to Adriana Poloz, and then straight from her back to the NSIA.

But I’d have to go through the entire document. And it’s possible that Adriana would have briefed me before sending it out. But I think one thing that we have to understand is the NSIA -- the RCMP is only one organization that’s providing criminal intelligence to the NSIA. You have the service, ITAC also has a role to play. So the NSIA is getting information before she forms an opinion. I get the brief. Whoever she’s getting information from, other departments as well.

Ms. Thomas was interested in a very short order. So it might be understandable that corners were cut or direct contacts were used, as you said. I’m just trying to figure out. You needed up getting copied on this, Deputy Commissioner. Did you appreciate the significance of the fact that people under your command were giving a threat assessment, or at least they’d been asked for a threat assessment, whether that’s how you would describe the product they delivered is another question.

If they're not comfortable with the information that we provide, and here's an example, we could provide information that we believe that the person's there, but if this person has a visa card and is somewhere in Canada, all of a sudden, we have to go back and double check and validate what we have.

23-281-06,"Well, it's all about public safety and officer safety. So when you have thousands of people, that is not the time to do enforcement because the risk to public and police safety is at a much higher level. So even sometimes if there's a Criminal Code offence, sometimes you will deal with it after the fact because if you go inside that crowd to deal with it, you might inflare [sic] that crowd. And just police presence can be enough to inflare [sic] a crowd on the right time at the, you know, being at the -- being there at the wrong time. So what -- our tactics are usually to reduce a footprint through incentivising or motivating people to leave. Obviously, sometimes it's as simple as you will be arrested, but there's always going to be groups of protesters who will stay and will wish to be arrested. But so you can't -- you still have to get rid of that footprint, so obviously, in the Ottawa scenario, on the weekends, it was far too big. And so trickling off Monday and, you know, looking at past -- we looked at past weeks and our numbers were the lowest on I think it was Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, so that was the time to start doing the enforcement. Unfortunately, we lost some time in our plan, so we did a very, you know, quick engagement of two days with the crowds to say, ""Now the Emergency Act is here. This is what will happen. If you don't leave, these are some of the consequences."" There was many people who actually wanted to leave, but their trucks were kind of stuck in amongst trucks. And those people we tried to make arrangements when the time came to move those trucks, to get them off the site. And once the footprint was down to a -- the minimum numbers we felt we could get them down to, that's when we started our enforcement action.

So the control access zone that was in place on Friday morning, that was a benefit to our operations in the sense that Friday morning, there's no one that was entering that -- kind of the control access zone other than the people that were already there, if they're not allowed to leave, not allowed to come back, so that limited.

It's when we have additional requests for assistance. There is one -- looking at the authorities that were in the Emergencies Act, and nobody is -- you know, nobody wants to infringe of anybody's Charter of Rights, but when people aren't following the laws this is where, like I said, we don't want to be having to use force to deal with that.

And you know, that 24 days that that lasted that was a huge drain on all resources in policing, and also it undermines policing who are trying to, you know, keep things as peaceful as possible. But you know, we talk about it. If we went in too early what would be the circumstance? What would people -- what would be the commentary if we came in too early and did quick enforcement? We'd probably be criticized for that, criticized for late enforcement. So how do we deal with this and not letting it last for 24 days because I don't think it's acceptable in anybody's books that that went on for as long as it did. But it was a difficult situation, and I have said this before I can't imagine the pressure that Chief Sloly was under during those days, and it's not an easy thing to reconcile.",23-295-24,295,24,23,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

In addition, we police communities with populations above 5,000 that have a desire to contract with the RCMP to provide that policing services, and those are primarily in the context of municipalities. So we have 48 municipal policing contracts in addition to our broader provincial policing contract within Alberta.

They're trained to de-escalate as well, so it would be similar to the PLTs, I think, maybe have been described previously during the Commission here and such.

23-303-28,"Yeah, I think it first came to our attention in -- well, I'll say on January 19th, we received some open source information suggesting that there was going to be a protest or a blockade at Coutts the very next day on the 20th of January. Again, on the 19th, there was a separate source of information received. I believe it was open source information that suggested there was going to be a blockade on the 29th of January at Coutts. So the 20th came and went without any protest, without any activity at the Coutts port of entry. On January 26th, we received some further open source information about a potential blockade, a convoy to Coutts and a potential blockade at Coutts as well. So we started to -- of course, started some of the planning around that. We engaged with our CCMG staff, identified the organizers of the convoy, and engaged in open communications with them. Over the course of the days leading up to the 29th, we had several meetings engaging partner agencies, including the Alberta sheriffs, Canada Border Services, also our U.S. partners in the U.S., CBP, some border patrol entities there as well. Some of the information indicated that there was going to be a number of trucks, up to a thousand trucks on the United States, on the USA side coming to the port of entry, so we had -- like I mentioned, we had engaged our U.S. partners there as well. We prepared to deploy some resources to Coutts for the 29th as well, but we had activated our Gold-Silver command structure as well. We had activated our division emergency operations centre because there were other planned protests or convoys in the Province of Alberta scheduled for January 29th as well. We consulted with legal counsel around our authorities, our authorities to stop vehicles just to confirm that as well too. So we took a number of steps in preparation for the possibility of a blockade. Now, I'll go back to our engagement with the protest organizers. And the last information, the best information that we had leading up to the 29th -- and it was from the protest organizers -- was that they were no longer going to blockade at Coutts, but they were simply -- well, not simply -- but they were going to conduct slow rolls through to Coutts with the convoy. And we were advised that it was their intention to do three slow rolls to Coutts, back to Milk River, the Canadian Milk River, which is also on Highway 4 north of Coutts, and that they would conduct three slow rolls through this area, ensuring that they had maintained at least one lane open at all times while they were conducting these slow rolls.",23-303-30,303,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

The general geography there, it’s very flat and open. And I’ll say, you know, through the ditches and fields, they’re very accessible if one was -- had a desire to move off the roadway and to travel through the ditches or into medians or into the adjacent fields as well.",23-306-24,306,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

So we worked with them with Canada -- with CBSA and U.S. CBP to allow them to turn around, move back through the U.S., and come back into Canada at another location.

And we got cooperation to do that. In fact, we were able to marshal some tow trucks -- I believe it was on the 31st -- and have them in place. As it turned, on the 31st, later in the day, we got the engagement from individuals within the protest group and started some communication, and actually some negotiation at that particular point, so we held off on any enforcement action at that particular time and held off until later in the day. Unfortunately, later in the day, those negotiations -- I’ll say “negotiations” -- fell off and, given that time of the day, we weren’t able to initiate any action with the tow trucks at that particular time. Our communication with the tow-truck operators and the companies was such that they indicated they would be back the next morning and, as such, it was the next morning that we planned to deploy resources into the protest group and, of course, first seek compliance for the operators of the vehicles to move along.

We created what we call the “Community Stakeholder Engagement Team”, so we assigned two senior police officers to engage with the community leaders in the area, so the community leaders from Coutts, and Milk River, and the municipalities, to work with them to help us find -- potentially find an area that would be suitable to create as a lawful protest area. We were cognizant that, you know, the protesters, to get them to move to such an area that, you know, this would have to be an area of visibility, so somewhere along the highway, potentially, was one of the requirements that we certainly had in mind as our folks undertook this work.

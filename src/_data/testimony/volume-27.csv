And what I’d like to do is begin with a little bit of housekeeping. I’ll remind -- Mr. Commissioner, I’ll remind parties through you that we have already had the interview summary of these three witnesses adopted during the closed session, which took place on November 5th. We also had the confidential and public versions of the Institutional Report adopted during that session, but the one item that has not yet been adopted is the summary that was posted yesterday of the closed session. And so witnesses, I would you ask each in turn to confirm that you reviewed that summary for accuracy and adopt it as part of the evidence of CSIS and ITAC before the Commission today.

And, witnesses, if we go to the second page -- Mr. Clerk, if you could scroll down just -- exactly there, thank you.

27-011-26,"Yes, certainly. I am the Executive Director of ITAC; I’ve been in that position since September 2021. ITAC is an organization that was created in 2004 out of the National Security Policy to independently produce threat assessment using a broad range of intelligence information, both at the unclassified and classified level. We have three main lines of operation. The first one is to assess and recommend national terrorism threat level for Canada; the second one is to report and assess terrorism- related event trends and threats; and the last one is to assess and set terrorism threat level for Canadian interests worldwide.",27-011-28,11,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-012-13,"Yes. So ITAC is co- located with CSIS headquarters, and we operate under the CSIS Act.

27-012-28,"Yes, of course. So as I mentioned, ITAC was created in 2004, so after the CSIS Act was enacted. And when -- it was created, after the 9/11 incident, basically, to avoid siloes in intelligence assessments. And when it was created, it was decided by the department at the time to put it under the CSIS Act.

27-013-26,"Yes, so we use a very rigorous methodology to do that. So our analysts are trained to look at a number of indicators to come up with a recommendation. So the methodology uses both qualitative indicators and quantitative indicators. We look at all available intelligence. We consult with many security partners, and we specifically do an assessment of threat actors, intent, capabilities and opportunities to conduct an act of terrorism. Very important to point out that the assessment is specifically on the likelihood of an act of terrorism occurring in Canada. So once we've done all this work, those consultation, this analysis, we do it at least three times a year, or more often as required. When I'm satisfied with the assessment, we present it to the Director who then decides whether or not he takes the recommendation or the proposed level.",27-013-28,13,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-014-14,"And just before we go over to you, Mr. Vigneault, as to your role in this, perhaps, Madam Chayer, you could explain whether there is any relationship between the definition we've seen a lot of in this hearing, that is, the 2(c) definition of threat to the security of Canada and the conclusion you and your organization makes on the national terrorism threat level.",27-014-16,14,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMPBELL,gordon campbell
27-014-21,"Yes, of course. So the -- so as you very well know, the 2(c) and all the Act unlocks investigative powers for the service; right? ITAC is not a collecting agency. We do not collect intelligence. We assess already collected intelligence. And so the intelligence that the service collects under 2(c), this is the intelligence that we assess, along with other informations or consultations with partners to come up with a recommendation of the threat level.",27-014-23,14,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-015-11,"So, of course, after reviewing carefully the material, I need to satisfy myself that I concur with the analysis, and I can, you know, agree or disagree with the recommendation to set the threat level. And so I do that, as Madam Chayer described, regularly during the year, or as required if there is a specific incident that, you know, happens in between those set time periods.",27-015-13,15,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-015-18,"And tell me, is this sometimes a subject of dialogue between CSIS and ITAC where you receive a threat level recommendation and perhaps ask for more information, or query the conclusion, or give other feedback?",27-015-20,15,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMPBELL,gordon campbell
27-015-22,"M'hm. The way it works is that it could be a combination of, you know, regular dialogue, and so while the assessment is being made, you know, Madam Chayer and I will have part of different meetings. We discuss the terrorism issues in Canada and abroad. And so our common understanding it will be formed through those discussions, and it happens also that, you know, when I receive the formal material, I will ask to sit down with the Executive Director of ITAC to formally question some elements, to make sure that I understand exactly what's the basis of the analysis and make sure that I'm comfortable with such analysis, and then I'm the position to make the determination of the threat level.",27-015-24,15,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. DAVID VIGNEAULT,david vigneault
27-016-06,"Thank you. Now, witnesses, we are going to go through an exercise that we've colloquially, Commission Counsel have colloquially called CSIS 101, similar to some of the questions you got asked in your interview and in the closed session. Probably, Madam Tessier, these are mostly for you. This is your working, the concepts you work with every day, but other witnesses, please feel free to add or qualify as you think appropriate. And these questions, witnesses, will be about your core mandate, so your -- what soon we will come to call your section 12 mandate, but your mandate to investigate threats to the security of Canada. And so let's start with section 12, and, Mr. Clerk, if you could call -- well, you might already have it on hand. It's the same document, the DOJ.IR.00000001, and page 2. You have in the second paragraph that begins pursuant, an extract from section 12, which I'll just read for the transcript. Pursuant -- and the first part is a lead in, and I'll mention when the quotation starts, ""Pursuant to [section] 12 of the CSIS Act, CSIS..."" And here the extract from the Act begins, ""...""shall collect, by investigation or otherwise, to the extent that it is strictly necessary, and analyse and retain information and intelligence respecting activities that may on reasonable grounds be suspected of constituting threats to the security of Canada and, in relation thereto, shall report to and advise the Government of Canada."""" Now perhaps I'll put it over to you, Ms. Tessier, to describe the function that section 12 serves in the CSIS -- in the core mandate work of CSIS.",27-016-08,16,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMPBELL,gordon campbell
27-017-12,"Certainly. Thank you for the question. It is really what defines what our mandate is, as you mention, in terms of opening investigation, collecting information and reporting to the Government of Canada. The intelligence cycle is such that the Government of Canada issues intelligence requirements to the Security and Intelligence community, of which CSIS, of course, is a part, and we then issue direction to our regional offices to collect the information that can fulfil that intelligence requirement, we analyse it in our headquarters, and we subsequently disseminate our assessments to the Government of Canada.",27-017-14,17,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MS. MICHELLE TESSIER,michelle tessier
27-017-23,"Right. And we'll probably come back to this as we're discussing some of the other definitions, but is it fair to say that if we go to the second line there and the words ""information and intelligence respecting activities"", that activities is a central concept in section 12 and in your mandate?",27-017-25,17,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-018-12,"Okay. And the standard which we've already seen talked about a fair bit in the hearing to date is in the third line there, that is to conduct an investigation, to have the authority to investigate these activities, the grounds of proof are described there as reasonable -- sorry, ""activities that may on reasonable grounds be suspected of constituting threats"", so sometimes shortened to reasonable grounds to suspect, and that's the basic threshold that decides what -- I'm going to put it in my terms, when you go from being a sponge, just absorbing information and monitoring situations to actively collecting and investigating a target; is that a fair description?",27-018-14,18,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-018-26,"Thank you. Mr. Clerk, could we go over to page 6 of this same document, and at about three-quarters of the way down that page, there is the heading Targeting Authority, and the first sentence describes a standard for your operations. It's the second paragraph that I want to focus on for a minute here, and this is, if you were to ask the question, ""Activities of whom or activities of what is it that you're investigating?"" And so you would use the expression, if I can ask you to confirm this to make sure I've got it correct, Ms. Tessier, the activities of an individual, a group of persons or an organisation. Is that correct?",27-018-28,18,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMPBELL,gordon campbell

27-019-11,"And to follow through with the definition we've just worked with: ""...whose activities are reasonably suspected of constituting a threat..."" And then this is expanded in the second sentence of this same paragraph, which I'll read: ""CSIS may also target issues or events to allow for an investigation of activities which are reasonably suspected of constituting a threat to the security of Canada that arise because of or are related to the issue or event..."" And then parenthetically you give the example of: ""...(Threats to Vancouver 2010 Olympics)."" And perhaps you could -- the example, Threats to Vancouver 2010 Olympics, is helpful. Perhaps you could help us flesh out the concept of targeting issues or events with another example of an issue or event that might have come under the Service's attention for the purposes of an investigation of a threat?",27-019-13,19,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-020-05,"Certainly. That type of targeting level is normally used when there is what we call a ""special event"", where you can have high-profile individuals attend, such as politicians or the like, who could be victims of a variety of threats. So it allows us, when we don't have a specific, I'll call it an ""aligned threat"", to be able to investigate leads that may come out as a result of that being held and any potential threat to that event, spectators, to the individuals attending, high profile personalities, that type of issue.",27-020-07,20,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

The -- I will say at the outset that ideologically motivated violence and extremism is very difficult to define when it meets a CSIS threshold, when it meets the threshold of terrorism. And that is something that we share internationally with -- when we’re talking with our partners, because it is a complex threat. We adopted that term because of the complexity and the number of ideologies that can fit into it. We didn’t want to get into right wing, left wing. That can mean different things to different people, could be just a legitimate view point. And so we wanted to highlight the various, I’ll call them steps, or criteria is a better word, that would bring CSIS’ investigations into the fore. So we wanted to be ideologically motivated. So it’s not just a personal grievance. It is something somebody fundamentally believes in and they want a societal change. So they want to change the world.

While there are groups in the IMV space they’re not as defined in the same way, they don’t necessarily have command and control, and it’s really a movement of individuals of sometimes various elements of these ideologies, and networks of individuals is a better way of describing it than actual strict groups, as what we’ve seen in the past.",27-035-04,35,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

And -- but we take -- we use all our methodologies -- again, if we feel that we have sufficient information to begin an investigation, then we’ll use the techniques and our methodologies, such as surveillance or what have you, that enable us to investigate that threat further. But it is always a challenge to know when somebody’s going to move from the online space to the physical space; that’s obviously of great concern.

27-040-23,"Maybe I will answer on this one. I think it's not just a question of mis-information, dis-information because that is in and of itself not something that, you know, we need to be aware of it, conscious of it, but it's not something that we need to determine ourselves. The -- it's more linking back to the intent and the capabilities of the individual. So unfortunately, social media, internet is full of information that is misleading, that could be mis-information, as Ms. Tessier described, could be also purposefully misleading, so that would be dis-information. So I think, you know, we're more interested in understanding the dynamic and then apply that understanding to our analysis of specific activities, specific individuals.

27-041-16,"Yeah, because what we have seen, unfortunately, a number of the individuals that -- who have perpetrated acts of terrorism, in Canada, we've had, you know, since 2014, we have 25 people who have been killed by terroristic activities by people who were motivated by violent extremist ideologies. And so when you dissect, deconstruct their motivation, often because they left manifestos or writings behind and so on, you see a conflation of different issues, it could be, you know, xenophobic ideology. And then when you start to look at the material and the understanding, you realise that there is a lot of mis-information, dis-information that is weaved into their writings or their understanding that creates that belief of these individuals that they must act. So that's why we, CSIS, will need to have that kind of awareness, not because we will be interested, you know, in every mis-information, dis-information that exists, but that reality informs the threat-related activity of -- that we must investigate.",27-041-18,41,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS.

We, of course, have been, you know, aware, generally aware of, you know, what's happening in our country. We have seen the tension that, you know, was created by reticence or a different perspective on public health measures. We saw, of course, the -- in the mid-January when the government mandate on the -- that will apply to truckers, you know, came -- what was being discussed and what was about to take effect, we saw this kind of, you know, increasing volatility and intensity of being -- opposing those measures. So we kept a general awareness of that. We saw some subjects of investigation of CSIS, so the individuals who were already meeting the thresholds that Ms. Tessier described earlier. Started to get interested in the discussion and discussing potential ways of engaging. And so at that point, we started to engage more resources, both in our Headquarters in terms of analytical understanding, but also across the region. CSIS is an intelligence organisation that has offices across the country and across the world. So we started to engage our regional offices in Canada, and in some stations abroad to better understand the dynamic.

27-044-10,"I would maybe clarify, Commissioner. I would say, you know, we were of course, you know, focussing on our subject of investigations, but also, the dynamic of such events is that you have people, sometimes it can refer to lone wolves or individuals who might be further radicalised by the protest. And so our work was to engage with our federal partners, with law enforcement at the federal, provincial, municipal level in Ottawa and across the country to understand how potentially what was happening in the protest world, if I can put it this way, could have an influence on individuals who may -- those who were known already to us, are subject to investigations or others who could be radicalized. So it was essentially a two-fold analysis, making sure we understood what our subject investigations were doing, associating with and so on, but also understanding who were others who could potentially radicalize, who could potentially start to recruit and meet others to further threat-related activity. And so that focus is one that we maintain from the beginning till the end. And to a large extent that’s what we continue to do, is we always make sure that, you know, we don’t have tunnel vision in our analysis; is that we challenge ourselves on an ongoing basis to make sure that our perspective of threat-related activity is not just, you know, linear and doesn’t change.

There has been online commentary calling for violence and storming Parliament Hill buildings.” And then the next bullet: “CSIS is tracking...engagement of [its] targets in relation to the convoy. Over the coming days, CSIS will be monitoring the involvement of these targets and other persons of [interest], in particular for any indications of mobilization to violence.” So what does -- what do those two bullets mean there?

So these are the knowns -- known actors, if you want. Our work as well is to make sure, as I mentioned, that we don’t have tunnel vision; that we just don’t look at what we know, but also in this context of other people who might be influence by the events, by some specific decision, by the government, some specific radical rhetoric online to say, “It is my time; I need to do something.” So our professional’s thesis and in ITAC are trained to really understand well the distinctions we’re talking about, about 2 (c)and so on; about what is lawful dissent and protest versus what are activities that could be potentially, you know, threat-related activity under the CSIS Act.

So we’re again going back very closely to the 2(c) definition we’ve talked about earlier. So a declaration of an event that is unlawful. For example, you know, you can have a permit for a demonstration and then, you know, there’s too many people, therefore your demonstration is outside the bounds of the permit. It could be unlawful, but that would not engage us.

And it’s the last line on page 2 here, if I can read it: “Further, CSIS will also continue to follow the evolving and dynamic situation surrounding the [convoy] to identify any […] national security concerns.” That is really important to underline, was that this was a very fluid, volatile environment, and we were constantly doing our assessments. So every day we were relooking at our information, our investigations, to ensure that we were up to date on our assessments.

Rather, strategic analysts provided multiple assessments throughout the relevant period, which were approved at higher levels before they were disseminated.

Mr. Vigneault explained that based on both his understanding that the Emergencies Act definition of threat to the security of Canada was broader than the CSIS Act, as well as based on his opinion of everything he had seen to that point, he advised the Prime Minister of his belief that it was indeed required to invoke the Act.""

If I understand what you're saying there, you have an understanding, and we might find out later in the week where you got that understanding, but that'll -- I'll let you keep that as an mystery for now, you had an understanding that the Emergencies Act definition of threats to the security of Canada was broader than the CSIS Act definition; correct?",27-064-16,64,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON (cont’d),MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-064-21,"Yes. And maybe if you allow me, Commissioner, I just want to go back to the first element that you took me through, Mr. Cameron, which was the -- that, you know, when I learned that the Emergencies Act was to be invoked, I, you know, informed myself. So this, I think, is the crux of the issue. So as Director of CSIS, we are very familiar, you know, my colleague and I, you know, we know the Act fairly well, the CSIS Act. I was not familiar with the details of the Emergencies Act. So when that was first brought up, the fact that the Emergencies Act was using the same words as the CSIS Act to define the threat, so imported into the Emergencies Act, I needed to understand for myself and for, you know, the course of this, what was the implication of that. And that's when I was assured that, you know, they were -- it was a separate understanding. You know, the confines of the CSIS Act, the same words, based on legal interpretation, jurisprudence, Federal Court rulings and so on, there was a very clear understanding of what those words meant in the confines of the CSIS Act, and what I was reassured by, is that there was, you know, in the context of the Emergencies Act there was to be a separate interpretation based on the confines of that Act. And that it was, you know, instrumental starting on the -- on that -- the 10th, I believe, when we discussed that, to make sure that we understand, you know, and how we would be, not informing, but you know, using the words very carefully and very much specify, you know, when we were providing advice and information it was based on the CSIS Act definition. So I just wanted to maybe contextualise this a little bit, so thanks for that.",27-064-23,64,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON (cont’d),MR.

27-065-25,"Thank you for that elaboration. Now, if we can go back to that sentence at the bottom of page 8, I understand -- I think the words do speak for themselves, but I want to make sure I understand your sense of them, that based on your understanding that the Emergencies Act definition of threats to the security of Canada was broader than the CSIS Act, then it says: ""...as well as based on his opinion if everything he had seen to that point..."" So if I'm understanding the way you've put those two together, that if you take a broader definition and then look more broadly you come up with the advice you gave to the Prime Minister of your belief that it was required to invoke the Act.",27-065-27,65,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

These are IRG meeting minutes for the February 13th meeting, and at page 12, we'll find the report to government that you commissioned, Mr. Vigneault, when you learned that the Government was considering the invocation of the Act. And you've mentioned elsewhere in your evidence, I think it's now well understood by the Commission and the parties, that as you learned that the Government was considering the invocation of the Emergencies Act, a concern that you had because of your understanding of the IMVE space, and feel free to join in, Ms. Tessier, if you want to add here, the concern was that the invocation of the Act actually had the potential to, I think the word ""inflame"" is used, but to raise the temperature and actually increase the risk of the threat of serious violence.

And in this context was to make sure that the Government, yes, within the confine of the -- the reflection on the invocation of the Emergencies Act, but also more broadly about, you know, what is happening in the country and what could be -- how could the dynamic change, we felt it was important that, you know, we took that expertise within the Service and we shared that more broadly with partners, with the Government to -- so that everybody had that understanding that we had at the Service.

And then Ms. Khan asked us earlier about this information/mis-information, and that would be a good example of how some objective decision could be misconstrued, deliberately or not, and what is the impact on potential threat activity in Canada.

The area that I’d like to start with is about information flow, so Mr. Vigneault, maybe I’ll start with you as the Head of CSIS, because you can speak to your role in advising kind of up the line. But as I understand it, and my friend has taken you through the definition of CSIS, but the mandate of CSIS is to investigate threats to the security of Canada? Is that correct? Is your mic on? Can you try again? Okay.",27-073-07,73,7,6,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. CHRISTOPHER DIANA,MR. CHRISTOPHER DIANA,christopher diana

27-074-01,"Yes. And so that’s how it worked.

27-074-16,"And so when we’re thinking about information flow and we think about things that can go wrong in that process, there are a couple of things -- well, there were a number of things, but a couple of kind of main things that can go wrong in terms of what you do in advising decision makers.

So those who need to know specific details, we endeavour to share those details with them. And -- but the same thing with criminal investigations and national security investigations, you just need to make sure to maintain the integrity of those investigations, that you, you sometimes, you know, will -- you know, you take the two concepts of sharing as much information as possible, while making sure that those who need to know have the same information.

So there are a number of rules that are -- have been put in place having learned over times what the pitfalls were, and Ms. Tessier referred to earlier as the one vision process, which is an elaborate process that has been in place with the -- between the RCMP and CSIS to make sure that we are sharing all of the information, you know, relevant, in the right way, to enable law enforcement.",27-080-04,80,4,2,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

The second thing is that we also, through jurisprudence, through Federal Court rulings, Commission of Inquiries, and review bodies who have access to all of our information, that understanding of the Act was very much more clarified, and so very -- with a lot of specificity, if you want, in many aspects.

As you saw in the pod goal’s chats, the trucker convoy and some of their more extreme comments, [i.e. calling for a January 6-style insurrection] are getting more coverage in media. Alex was surveying where there’d be interest in his boss [that’s the Public Safety’s Minister] doing some media on this eventually. He was chatting with Mendicino about right before he went into the Cabinet retreat. I think there could be an opportunity in getting in on the narrative of the truckers, particularly with the research that the LRB is doing into their backers. My thoughts of framing here would be similar to what the PM and Blair said last year when January 6 occurred; our democracy is something we need to nurture and protect every day. We will always protect the right to peaceful protest. Some calls that organizers of these events are making are concerning and we’re taking them seriously [we’d need something to back this up]. Will continue to monitor the situation closely, and the fine line to walk would be to ensure we are not looking like we’re directing the police, which obviously is not the goal here. Hoping to canvas your thoughts. Alex said he’d come back to me with a proposal this aft when he gets to chat to Mendicino again, and obviously pending his boss in our interests in looking into this further.” (As read) Mr. Cohen responds: “Thanks.

Public Safety of course has a major role to play when it comes to the RCMP, CSIS, and IMVE threats, but we have a helpful perspective on the whole-of-government coordination + collaboration with other levels of government.

But it’s also very important in this comment when I say that it was different than the Criminal Code, is that you could have -- you could meet a definition of threat to the security of Canada under the CSIS Act or you could meet the sociological definition of terrorist activity, which I believe that Alexandre Bissonnette was indeed engaged in terrorist activity, but that may not transfer in the Crown charging someone for a terrorist offence.

Branching off of that -- thank you for bringing that up -- has CSIS considered whether UNDRIP's implementation means that there should be distinct considerations on CSIS's ability to monitor non-violent and unarmed First Nation's people who engage in activism pertaining to their lawful rights, even in situations that are perceived to be public order emergency events that are allegedly unlawful?",27-140-30,140,30,28,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

27-141-08,"So as I mentioned earlier, we have not done a full analysis of the intersection between the CSIS Act and UNDRIP. What I can say is that, as I think testament to the document I just pulled out there, we tried to really understand how we can discharge our mandate as directed by -- under the law that Parliament has given us, but make sure that we do that in a way that is sensitive to how a lawful protest including in your question, Counsel, the Indigenous protest is taking place. We have testified that we are -- we cannot monitor, investigate lawful protest and dissent. And our analysis, you know, of events always takes that to account. That is not to say that we will not be, of course, you know, in order to make a determination, if there is a threat to security, of course we looked at a number of different issues, and I think there were some documents that recently on the Access to Information Act that concluded that CSIS advised government that, you know, maybe some Indigenous protests did not constitute a threat to the security of Canada, which is, I think, an important point to make sure that people understand when -- when there are potentially law enforcement action, they understand how we see it from our own mandate’s point of view.",27-141-10,141,10,8,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

27-142-01,"Okay, thank you. I’m going to wrap up with just a few last questions. So, in your mandate letter in May 2022, Minister Mendicino mandated that CSIS must work to eliminate any systemic racism or unconscious bias in its operations. He specifically made reference to ensuring that “minority communities” are not subject to unfair scrutiny in the name of national security and that CSIS “ensured the intelligence and evidence used when making determinations are free of bias, prejudice, and up to date”. What work is CSIS doing or planning specifically to eliminate anti-Indigenous discrimination in its operations, monitoring, intelligence gathering, and analysis, or reporting to other government to other government branches or agencies specifically in the context of Indigenous rights defenders?",27-142-03,142,3,1,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. CHEYENNE ARNOLD-CUNNINGHAM,MS. CHEYENNE ARNOLD-CUNNINGHAM,cheyenne arnold-cunningham
27-142-16,"I would say that there are probably three main aspects to -- of our work. The first one is, I think, as exemplified by the document I pulled out, our intelligence professionals within the organization are trained and continue to receive training to better understand, you know, how the work that they do might be perceived, how it would have -- it would impact, you know, different communities differently, and to make sure that they have this awareness. So that -- the aspect of training is an important one. The other aspect is, as an organization, in terms of our management of our organization, how do we make sure that we bring diversity, that we continue to work to have a much more diverse organization, that we have -- we understand that, you know, some of our policies and procedures might -- not intending to be, you know, biased but, you know, the net effect might be systemic racism and we want to understand how this works, and we have -- we take measures to correct that internally in our own procedures. And finally, I would say we have launched a very specific stakeholder outreach program to make sure that we understand and we meet with communities that we -- I had the chance personally, early in my tenure, to meet with the Assembly of First Nations to establish some contact, some ability to talk to each other so if there are any concerns, any issues, that were are -- we have those lines of communications open because it is -- it is very complex work that CSIS professionals do and we want to make sure that we understand how it is being received and perceived by the population we serve.",27-142-18,142,18,16,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. CHEYENNE ARNOLD-CUNNINGHAM,MR. DAVID VIGNEAULT,david vigneault
27-143-16,"Okay. And last question, do you have any specific Indigenous officials working in those advisory positions, whether it be an advisory body, an internal committee, or just an advisor to advise on matters such as making sure, you know, surveillance of ideologically motivated activism doesn’t supress legitimate activism by Indigenous peoples regarding their rights?",27-143-18,143,18,16,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

27-143-23,"I would point out to you two specific bodies, if you want. One is an internal one; it’s called the Black Indigenous Persons of Colour Congress within CSIS, the BIPOC Congress. So we -- and I personally meet with them. The last meeting was probably a month and a half ago, where we are sitting down and looking at our specific strategies, plans to make sure that we get their input before it is -- our policies are changed. So we want the input, we want co-development of some of these approaches. So that is an internal one. And the second one I would say is not as much an advisory body but it -- the fact that our activities are reviewed by two specific agencies, the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency, NSIRA, and the National Security Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, NSICOP. Both organizations have access to all of the specific classified details of our operations and are looking at our ability to make sure that, you know, we not only respect the law but, you know, our procedures. And NSICOP, in the last couple of years, has indeed looked at how the security intelligence community was engaging with communities and how we were making efforts be a much more diverse and inclusive organization.",27-143-25,143,25,23,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

Not anybody could adhere to Al-Qaeda. Whereas, today, especially given the internet and the ability to network together on social media, there is difficulty in just having -- comparing it to what would have been the case in the past, where you had a physical presence, you had to be vetted to be part of this group. Not to say that there are some IMVE groups that don't do that, most certainly there are, but given the vastness of communications today, especially on the internet and various social media sites, the ability to get to know individuals who share your extreme ideology is a lot easier than it would have been in the past. And so it's these -- that's why we prefer to call them networks. And we referred to lone wolves earlier, how one person can commit an act. They don't necessarily have to be directed to do so.

The panel agreed that since 2020, there has been an increase in IMVE online rhetoric and threat[...] to authority figures, including law enforcement, public and elected officials.

27-164-02,"So again, we’ve done a lot of work inside the organization to better understand the dynamic of IMVE, what’s happening in society, whether there are some social movements that potentially are -- have an impact on our CSIS mandate. And this, if you can maybe reduce the size of the font? If you look at this, it has the shape of a funnel. And essentially what we try to do with this is to explain at the top of the funnel is, you know, a lot of personal grievances relating to Islamophobia, you know, oppression of Indigenous people, the fear -- you know, conspiracy theories, like Q-Anon, xenophobia, neo-Nazi influences. So there’s a lot of things that, you know, circulate in society. And that is essentially what is unfortunately very present on social media when I referred to earlier as awful but lawful. We see a lot of that potentially extremely violent and vile information. But again, this is protected by Charter. This is, you know, acceptable in a democracy. And the further down you go to the funnel, you know, you’re getting into areas that, you know, might be potentially considered hate speech under the Criminal Code. And at the narrowest part of the funnel, this is where, you know, CSIS, our analytical analysis described, this is where the narrowest part of the funnel, where our 2(c) investigation would kick in. And so that is a conceptual analytical construction to help identify what is happening in society and where we, versus the police, versus other elements of the society should be concerned with. You know, CSIS should not be -- should be informed with what’s happening on the top of the funnel, where it’s lawful, we are informed by that information, but we’re not investigating that. That is, you know, lawful information. And where we are, as I said, is the narrowest part of the funnel. So one other element that is, I think, critical, in all of this, is we’ve said earlier on that people can radicalize extremely quickly, or mobilize to violence very quickly. So we’ve seen people, you know, move from the consumer, as my colleague said, consumer of that -- those narratives, to go down and very quickly to say, “I need to do something about it. I will mobilize. I will engage. I will train. I will acquire weapons. And I will commit violence.” And so this is our attempt to depict what is happening in society and where the CSIS mandate fits.",27-164-04,164,4,2,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

27-166-09,"Thank you, Mr. Commissioner, two brief points of clarification, I hope, though I see my friend, Mr. MacKinnon, rewrote the summary himself while delivering it to the witness so it might be that it’s had the salutary affect that we need here. I think this question is for you, Mr. Vigneault, and I’d that the summary of the closed session, which is WTS, zeros, 79, you brought up, and if we could to the top of page 9, maybe the bottom of page 8 and the top of page 9. Thank you. And this passage has had some discussion a fair bit already today so I won’t repeat the whole thing but, Mr. Vigneault, I think what some people have expressed some puzzlement about is just the way you’ve phrased it. And you know that if I tried to say something in French, you would have to cover your ears, so I’m not faulting your English here; it’s just that sometimes we see Francophones express things this way and I want to see if I can offer you an alternative expression in English or, if you’d prefer, just ask you to say it in French. The way you’ve phrased the last eight or 10 words there allows for two meanings in English that I don’t think -- I think you intended only one them. So it says: ""…he advised the prime minister of his belief that it was indeed required to invoke the Act."" And some people are wondering if “it” has any meaning other than an article that is reflexive to invoke the Act. So one way of rewording that might be, “Advised the prime minister of his belief that the invocation of the Act was required,” or, “It was,” as Mr. MacKinnon put it, “necessary to invoke the Act.” Do either of those sound right to you?

Now, just before we start, if I could just -- I just want to make a brief statement that from now on, for the balance of the week, we will be hearing from a number of senior government ministers, including the prime minister and the deputy prime minister. The Commission recognizes that this is exceptional and even more so as the House, as I understand it, is sitting. So the latter fact, the fact the House is sitting, is such that it may require some accommodation for these witnesses in the event of votes of the House of Commons or events requiring that they respond to pressing needs. So I just wanted to put that on the record, so for parties. It's also important that in the course of these examinations, we not lose sight of the reason that they are here to testify; that is, the subject matter of this Inquiry. The examinations, therefore, must remain focused on this, particularly in light of the limited time we have. Finally, as I have insisted throughout, I will continue to insist that the conduct of the public and indeed the parties be respectful at all times, which I'm sure everyone understands. So I just wanted to say that because it's -- we're sort of entering another phase for the balance. Okay.

27-171-27,"Now, in the prime minister's mandate letters, that is, the letters that the prime minister writes for each of his ministers to describe what he expects from them during their tenure, the prime minister assigned leadership responsibilities regarding public safety and emergency preparedness, both to you, Minister Blair, and to Minister Mendicino. And so the question is, can you help us understand how that division works under the umbrella of the Ministry of Emergency Preparedness and Public Safety?",27-171-29,171,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-172-09,"Yes, sir. As you've noted earlier, I had -- I previously held the position of Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. Quite frankly, the government recognized in the most recent past a significant increase in both the severity, complexity, and frequency of national emergencies taking place in this country. And so a decision was made to bifurcate my previous ministry into Public Safety, which is a portfolio held by my colleague and friend, Mr. Mendicino, and Minister of Emergency Preparedness, which is the portfolio that I am responsible for. Under that, I think there's a very clear delineation of responsibilities, but there's a very close alignment between the work that I do and that Minister Mendicino does. Mr. Mendicino is, for example, responsible under the Act for five different, you know, significant agencies in the federal government, including the RCMP, CBSA, CSIS, Corrections Canada, and the Parole Board, and he also has a number of other significant responsibilities within his own mandate. For myself, my responsibilities particularly pertain to ensuring that the Government of Canada is prepared to respond effectively to all hazards and emergencies in this country to improve of the way in which the government prepares and also creates greater resiliency in the country about these events. Among the administrative processes, I am also responsible for is I oversee requests for assistance that I receive from the provinces and territories for assistance in the event of an emergency.",27-172-11,172,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-173-22,"Yeah, the scribes at the interview got lost after a few minutes of the interview. Now, if -- that’s a helpful description, Minister Blair, of the division between the two parts of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. Here's something that’s more challenging for all of us is if you can describe for us your role as President of the King's Privy Council and how that -- what role you play there? I'll remind you just as what place to start that among other things, you chair the SSE committee, the Safety, Security, and Emergencies committee, but writ large, can you describe that office and what responsibilities come with it?",27-173-24,173,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-174-07,"There are, within federal legislation, certain federal agencies such as the Transportation Safety Board, that is -- answers directly to the President of now the King's Privy Council, but it also is important to recognize the very -- the close collaboration that exists between my responsibilities as the President of the King's Privy Council and the work of the Privy Council Office within the federal government. It requires, in addition to my responsibilities in chairing, for example, the SSE -- Safety, Security, and Emergency committee, a very close collaboration with the Privy Council Office. I have, for example, within PCO, a deputy secretary, Ms. Bogden, who I believe you've heard from, who I work very closely with on matters of emergency preparedness and with respect to other Cabinet-related issues. I work very closely with the deputy clerk, Ms. Drouin, as well.",27-174-09,174,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER WILLIAM BLAIR,minister william blair
27-174-23,"Right. And something we'll come back to in a little bit of detail a little later in this examination, one of the functions of your office includes handling requests for assistance, what we've now learned to call RFAs where somebody from a level of government lower than the federal government asks for the assistance of the federal government in some particular sphere. Can you tell us just broadly speaking how that works? We'll come to the one specific to the convoy in a minute, but just broadly, how that process works.",27-174-25,174,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-175-05,"Yes, sir. There is a provision within our government for provinces and territories to make requests of our government for assistance for certain types of emergencies. The criteria is reasonably well established. In the past two years, I've been responsible for -- well, since the beginning of the pandemic, I've actually managed about 200 requests for assistance that the government has received from our provincial and territorial partners. These can take a number of different forms. There were quite a number of them related to the pandemic in particular, but also in the advent of floods and fires, on the hurricanes that recently took place in Atlantic Canada, all can result when -- when events exceed the capacity of the provinces and territories to manage it, the RFA process allows them to reach out for assistance, and whatever we're able to provide is my responsibility to arrange that. Much of that work is done with other federal departments, Public Safety, the Department of National Defence, and others, but to ensure that whatever federal supports can be provided to the provinces and territories, we do that as expeditiously as possible.",27-175-07,175,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER WILLIAM BLAIR,minister william blair
27-175-26,"And can you describe to me the level of formality that that process follows, and it's probably not the same in every case, but sometimes it's a phone call, perhaps followed up later by writing; sometimes writing followed up later by a phone call. But can you describe for the Commissioner just how the process tends to take place in the example of a typical flood or hurricane?",27-175-28,175,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-176-05,"In my experience, sir, and as I said with Danielle, a couple of hundred of these, senior officials usually begin talking very quickly. Even in anticipation of an emergency, for example, if we know that a hurricane is coming, or at the beginning of the wildfire season, communications begin to take place between senior officials in both either the province or territory and/or federal departments, whichever is implicated. Most of that is managed through the Ministry of Public Safety, and for example, in my experience, most of that work has been done by Deputy Stewart, who I think you've also heard from. There's usually discussions that take place between senior officials. There is also a table of senior officials, sometimes referred to as the Senior Officials Responsible for Emergency Management, SOREM, who also engages in these types of discussions. That's usually followed up very quickly by a formal letter of request from the province or territory that is directed to the Ministry of Public Safety and then on to me for a determination. But we try to work as quickly as possible in order to see if whatever helps we can provide in response to those requests, and then through, again, Deputy Stewart a response to that request is prepared to which I am able to then hopefully quickly respond.",27-176-07,176,7,5,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-177-04,"No, and in fact, in our most recent experience with Hurricane Fiona, it was -- as it was moving to Atlantic Canada, we were receiving very good forecasting from Environment Canada, which gave us a pretty good idea of where that hurricane was going to land. And so there were conversations that began days in advance so that we could be better prepared and mobilise and even stage resources in order to respond to what we knew was going to be a significant impact on those regions of the country and that we would be able to work closely together as quickly as possible. There are a number of other programs as well, and for example, I'm also responsible for what we refer to as the Humanitarian Workforce where we work very closely with an NGO, such as the Canadian Red Cross, and stage those resources and begin to register people well in advance of the hurricane in that case, so that we can respond as quickly as possible in real-time to help people be safe.",27-177-06,177,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-177-26,"Yes, sir. Those requests are properly documented, but we don't necessarily wait for the paperwork. Sometimes in -- there have been very limited circumstances where the paperwork arrive first, and then we start conforming to that immediately, but in the vast majority of cases there is outreach from the province and territory who identify a situation that exceeds their capacity where they seek our help, and then we undertake immediately to see if we can find that help within the Federal Government.",27-177-28,177,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Maybe you could just remind us, now that you're here, where they fit in the scheme of your Department of Emergency Preparedness.",27-179-03,179,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-179-07,"Yes, sir. When the Government decided, when the Prime Minister decided that -- to place a special emphasis and create a unique ministry dealing with emergency preparedness we recognised that in order to make that work we also had to fundamentally change the way in which the Public Service, through the Privy Council Office, organises itself in response to preparation for emergency. And so there was decisions made within PCO by the Clerk in order to create some additional positions within the Privy Council Office to essentially create an office to more formalise and I think to make more effective the Government's response to emergencies and in our preparation in a wide variety, a very significant spectrum of activities, including increased resilience, investment in critical infrastructure and an all hazards approach, and it was also I think very important to make connections. One of the things I have found in my responsibility, sir, and working with PCO, that emergencies are not uniquely located within any one ministry or department. That is, they very often implicate, like, whole of government. We learned that certainly in floods, for example, in British Columbia, where, you know, initially, when I went to British Columbia with the Prime Minister to meet with the provincial government, you know, we looked at is as an emergency response to a flood, but very quickly learned that Agriculture, Transportation, Fisheries and Oceans, Natural Resources, Environment Canada, all of these different departments of Government were deeply implicated in that emergency. And so one of my responsibilities working with PCO and Ms. Bogden is in a convening role, to bring all of the departments together and bring senior officials to make sure that all of government is responding appropriately as necessary to every emergency. And so a decision was made. Ms. Bogden was brought in as the Deputy Secretary responsible for emergency management, and she also has responsibility for the COVID response of the Government, she's also overseeing that. And Mr. Hutchinson was also brought in and serves in a number of different roles, including he is Secretary to the Cabinet committee that I chair, the Safety, Security and Emergencies Committee. He's also acted as Secretary in other duties that I have been assigned by the Prime Minister. For example, I co-chaired with British Columbia a committee with the British Columbia Government involving all of the ministers and very significant representation from First Nations leadership in coordinating all of Government's response to the floods, and Jeff acted as the Secretary for that committee as well.",27-179-09,179,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

I was, throughout that entire period of time, the Chief of Police, and therefore, responsible for policing in my city, but the event itself was actually headed up by an Integrated Command Structure with a gold/silver/bronze command structure that was put in place, the leadership of which was with the RCMP, but also, it had representatives from my service but also from some of the regional services surrounding and the OPP. And they were actually responsible for the operational response to the G20, but throughout that period, I was the Chief of Police and therefore, ultimately, responsible for every policing related matter taking place in my city.",27-182-21,182,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER WILLIAM BLAIR,minister william blair
27-183-04,"Right. And as you mentioned, probably in the 30-odd year career, and especially 10 as Chief of Police, there were more than just the G20 event, and the one other perhaps event or series of events that was memorable during that period when you were Chief of Police were the Tamal protests in Toronto. And they -- I mention them because you might find some similarities with some of the events that happened around Ottawa, and if you could just tell us about those events and how they were resolved, at least as best as you can recollect it?",27-183-06,183,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-183-14,"Yes, sir. That took place in May of 2009. It was a period in which there was a great deal of concern within the Tamal community, and there's a very substantial Tamal community in the greater Toronto area, about events that were taking place in Sri Lanka at that particular time. I mean, as a consequence, a number of people came out onto the streets to begin to protest. There were two, frankly, significant and somewhat distinct matters that I had to deal with as the Chief of Police during that event. On Mother's Day of 2009, about 5,000 people from the Tamal community were demonstrating and marching, and unfortunately, went up a ramp of the Gardiner Expressway and ended up on the elevated highway that runs through downtown Toronto. I was called, because, of course, they had blocked the highway. It wasn't a particularly serious traffic issue because it was Mother's Day, a Sunday evening and not too concerning, but I heard from my operational commanders that evening that there were no safe ways to remove those people from the bridge. There was a real concern because the guardrail really is for vehicles, not for pedestrians. There were children and elderly people up on that elevated highway, and there was a very sincere concern among my officers that any action that we might take to remove them from the bridge or even bring them down the ramp could result in a stampede, a crushing of people, and would just be simply too dangerous. And so I directed that we would slow down, that we would engage with the people that were on the bridge. We would find people that we could talk to on the bridge, and that took a couple of hours. And then eventually, I engaged in some conversation, I had a pretty good relationship with that community, and found a way to have them safely come down off that bridge. And it was, in my opinion, an entirely appropriate and safe resolution of what could have potentially been a very dangerous situation. The other element to this is tens of thousands of people initially converged on University Avenue in the area of University and Armoury, which is right near the 361, our Superior Courts in Toronto, but also, right opposite the U.S. Consulate. And initially when they went there, it was considered quite disruptive. It was noisy and it was interfering with traffic. But very quickly, we were able to work with that crowd to allow the TTC, for example, to operate on both Queen and Dundas, so that the transit would continue to move. Those are pretty important transit routes in the city. We also were concerned about access and egress for our hospitals on Hospital Row on University Avenue. We worked out with them a way in which we could do that. And although that protest went on for several days, and there were concerns actually being expressed, by the time I remember hearing from Superior Court judges about the noise outside their courtrooms, but at the same time, you know, there was very little residential in that area. I would also want to acknowledge the people that were protesting did so in a very respectful way. They cleaned up after themselves. You know, they were on the street. They were very seriously concerned, but I think that was a situation that in Toronto, we were able to resolve appropriately and safely. And eventually, I think it actually strengthened our relationship very much with that community.",27-183-16,183,16,14,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER WILLIAM BLAIR,minister william blair
27-185-15,"And if I recollect accounts of those events, one of the things you were able to accomplish with that demonstration was to move it from an arguably illegal demonstration in the sense that it was blocking University Avenue to a location nearby where the demonstration could continue but not be obstructing traffic and potentially breaking the law?",27-185-17,185,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

They want, in effect, to cause at least enough of a nuisance that they're noticed and that they're able to make their point and be heard, and yet, you want them to be as little a nuisance as possible.

And then some people, you know, preferred to be -- you know, to disrupt traffic, or in the case of the G20, unfortunately, it also resulted in the set of circumstances where there was significant property damage, fires were set, and windows were smashed. And but I think it's important to distinguish there are always people who seek only to engage in lawful, peaceful protest, and who think it’s our responsibility -- and I say “Our,” forgive me; it was the police responsibility to facilitate that to every extent possible. And, unfortunately, there are also, in some circumstances, people who choose to engage in unlawful behaviour and don’t engage as lawful, but rather unlawful protest, and then there has to be whatever action is required in order to curtail that.",27-187-12,187,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Because I believe that the events that were transpiring in Ottawa did -- really did require good communication, you know, clear and -- clear expectations and communications in how we could assist each other. All of us had a responsibility, all of us had a role to play. And I was attempting to convene that.

One is the fact that you didn’t succeed in getting Ontario, at the political level, to the table, as I think had been your ambition. But the other topic is why there seemed, in at least the records of these meetings, so much confusion or misunderstanding between the City of Ottawa and the federal government, and to the extent they were there, officials of the Ontario government, about which resources would be committed by whom; when; who was actually there, et cetera. The documents just seem to be the equivalent of a whole bunch of ships passing in the night, and nobody understanding what the other person’s saying, and perhaps even a lot of mistrust.

And I understood that concern and I acknowledged that to her. She expressed some concerned that she did not want to be seen to be directing the police. And, actually, I had a very brief exchange because I’m also very familiar, as she was, with the Linden Commission report on the Ipperwash event. And I think there is an actual sensitivity and concern among Ontario officials about any appearance of being seen to direct the police. I would also acknowledge Minister Mendicino, who has a direct working -- reporting relationship, he is the -- he is essentially Minister Jones’ counterpart.

Now, we’ve already heard from the mayor and he’s given his side of this but, from your perspective, was -- were you disappointed that Ontario hadn’t participated in these meetings so far, and was it your sense that the mayor was also disappointed that Ontario, at least at the level you had hoped to have participation, hadn’t shown up at that meetings?",27-193-29,193,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

One of the things I tried to contribute to this discussion is that it wasn’t just a numbers plan; it wasn’t just about how many people. And in fact, I pointed out that it’s actually difficult to start talking about specific numbers because, you know, the number of police officers to be deployed is a matter, frankly, of police confidentiality and it can actually compromise police operations, in my experience, and so I cautioned about that. And so my recommendation is that we should be talking about resources. We should be talking about providing the support that the city needs without being specific about numbers. There had also been discussion, Mr. Cameron, throughout these tripartite meetings and in other fora about the need for an integrated action plan, not just how many people were required but how those people would then be utilized in order to affect the purpose of bringing the protest to a peaceful resolution.",27-195-22,195,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

But what we were seeking was assurances from those who did have operational responsibilities that they were satisfied an integrated operational plan, an action plan, and that they were prepared to action it. That, I think, was a consideration because it’s also useful to remember, I think, Mr. Cameron, there were a number of things happening right across the country at the time. You know, the OPP, in particular, were dealing with a difficult situation in Windsor. They had also had to respond to other events across Southern Ontario. Their resources were being quite significantly challenged because they had to continue to respond to a very dynamic and mobile threat across the country. And so my understanding was that, you know, they needed the clarity of an integrated command action plan that they’d all agreed to in order to facilitate the movement of people to go and deal with the situation in Ottawa.",27-196-23,196,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

We have heard from Commissioner Lucki that she wasn’t standing on protocol here, she was prepared to devote resources as quickly as she could while Ottawa sought help from the province as well. But putting aside those urgent first steps that were taken, did you have a sense of what the proper protocol was for Ottawa to follow in this context, putting in mind both the hats you were wearing as Minister of Emergency Preparedness and your history of having encountered similar situations doubtless over many years in Toronto?",27-197-14,197,14,12,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-197-24,"Yes, sir, to be very clear, there’s a number of different ways in which this has been approached, particularly if there’s a planned event. A planned event -- as I’ve already mentioned, the G20 in 2010, there was another planned event that I was involved in involving the visit of a US President to the City of Ottawa. This happened in the early 2000’s. That was a planned event where there was an integrated command structure put in place. At the time, I actually brought about 400 Toronto Police Service officers up here to Ottawa to work under that integrated command structure and to assist in public order for that event. I’m also aware because, frankly, I’ve been around a long time, that there was always a very close working relationship between all of the police services working in the National Capital Region. They convened a table that they refer to as INTERSECT. I’ve had no dealings with it in the recent period but I was familiar with it when I was a police chief, where the RCMP work very closely with the Ottawa Police Service. I believe the OPP were at the table, and the Gatineau Police. And so there’s always been good cooperation among the police services in the National Capital Region. I’m also very familiar -- I’ve been involved in very many incidents when I was a police officer where we would - - in the Toronto Police Service, we had, frankly, a lot of people. We had a lot of people trained in public order and we would bring our public order resources to assist in Kingston, for example, for their homecoming event, in other towns around Ontario that didn’t have those resources available so we would go and assist. But there’s also, and I’m aware, that within the Ontario Police Services Act, which is, frankly, the legislation that governs policing in the City of Ottawa and in the Province of Ontario, there is a provision in that Act that -- in circumstances that exceed the capacity of the police of jurisdiction, a municipal police service, to deal with an emergency, there is a provision within that Act for the chief to make a request to the Commissioner of the OPP, and the Commissioner is required under that act to respond. You may also make a request to another municipal police service and that municipal police service has the ability to decline. But there is a provision whereby a police service dealing with an emergency, exceeding their capacity to manage, can also, within the Act, make an appeal and a request to the OPP. I believe that was done, in fact, in Windsor, in response to the event at the Ambassador Bridge. It’s not -- it’s a rarely used provision of the Act, but it is a tool that was available.",27-197-26,197,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And that had - - that’s an approach that had been used successfully in the past. If that could be facilitated, that could be used, and if it wasn’t available to the Chief, there was the tool within the Ontario Police Services Act.",27-199-23,199,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-200-02,"Now, you described the use of either the formal use of the Police Services Act, or more likely, when you’re talking about planned events, simply consensual arrangements where looking perhaps months or even years ahead to an event, you can get a multi-police organization team put together. That doesn’t work if the event manifests itself over the course of a weekend. And so one thing that the Commissioner might be interested in your views on is whether it would assist matters to have a protocol in place so that there isn’t quite as much confusion and disagreement about whose responsibility it is to - - who goes where and who provides what, to have a protocol in place and perhaps even stand by memoranda of understanding or something so that it -- within days, rather than weeks, everybody knows who goes where, whose responsibilities are what, and the matter hopefully gets sorted out more quickly?",27-200-04,200,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

I’ve actually had the experience as a police chief making arrangements with other police services in the event of emergency, how many people I would send them and how quickly I’d be able to get them there, because we all know that certain types of events can exceed any of our capacity to respond to an emergency. Planned events are actually pretty straightforward. And I believe that we’ve got a long history and an element of success in dealing with, I’ll stop saying “we”, sir. In my previous capacity. The police services have a long history of working very collaboratively together for planned events. And a number of different things are worked out well in advance, including the integrated command structure, who is going to be in charge, a -- what they call -- what they often refer to as gold, silver command structure that is put in place, who is paying for what, and et cetera, what resources and obligations each of them will undertake to provide, is usually worked out well in advance.

You had the probably not entirely pleasant experience of having a Commission of Inquiry look into the events of G20, not an entirely pleasant experience of having your conduct examined in a Commission of Inquiry. And one of the issues that came up in the Morden Inquiry into the G20 event, and Ipperwash as well, had to do with the extent of administrative oversight and political input to the activities of the police. And so with -- again, with your long policing experience and your role now as a Minister of the Crown, can you start by giving us an overview of where you -- how you see either Police Board or other levels of government officialdom oversight of police, where you see that fits in and how you view what has been called in this hearing so far sometimes the line between church and state or the conundrum of how much police forces should resist political interference and that whole topic?",27-201-17,201,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

The Police Services Board is constituted under the Police Services Act. It’s defined on its duties and responsibilities and how it’s comprised. I very firmly believe, very sincerely believe, that good policing requires good governance. And governance is not to suggest, sir, that a police services board or the governance authority will direct the police in their investigations, in their operations, will even direct them in the administration of their police service. That’s not the function of good governance. The function of good governance, in my experience, is oversight and accountability. And I think it’s fairly well articulated in a number of provincial statutes across the country, including the Ontario Police Services Act. In my own personal experience, I used to meet with my Board every month for several hours over the course of a day. It was done in public. They would -- some of it was in- camera, much of it was in public. They would ask me questions about use of force. They would ask me about training. They would ask me about HR issues, the discipline and maintaining of conduct within my organization. I reported to them in a very public way about our engagement with diverse communities, about a number of efforts that we were making to prevent crime. All those things that were the responsibility of the police service to deliver adequate and effective police service, and that’s actually directive with the Board and then designated to me by the Board. The police have extraordinary authorities in our society, but those are not unfettered authorities. There’s an expectation that we will be held to accountable -- held to account for the way that we use those authorities, and that there will be independent civilian oversight for policing activities. And I believe that’s absolutely key. There is no good policing without good governance.",27-202-22,202,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-204-06,"And when you use “governance” in this context, you’re not talking about the police and his or her deputies. You’re talking about some level of ---",27-204-08,204,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-204-10,"No, sir. I’m talking about independent civilian oversight of policing. The police chief answers to someone. I answer to my Board. I work for my Board. And I was accountable to my Board and I understood that was my responsibility to be accountable, to answer their questions. They were always very careful, by the way, and I can’t remember -- recall one incident in 10 years where they ever directed me in an investigation, in an operation, but they asked me a lot of questions about what we were doing and why we were doing it. I believe it was my responsibility to provide them with that information so that they could fulfil their function of providing oversight to me and to hold me accountable for the job that I was doing. And so I know there’s been -- because I’ve watched. There’s been a lot of discussion about, you know, having a civilian or a politician directing the police. And that’s never acceptable. But at the same time, the police must be accountable to an independent civilian authority. Now that - - and that can be achieved through a government minister who is assigned responsibility, it can be done through a police services board, but in my experience, public -- policing is all predicated on public trust and the consent of the people who are policed. That trust is really warranted by that oversight, and accountability, and transparency, and the way those extraordinary authorities given to the police are exercised.",27-204-12,204,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER WILLIAM BLAIR,minister william blair
27-205-08,"Right. And in the time that you were Chief of Police and having this governance relationship with the Police Services Board, would you have considered that interreference, or what is sometimes called directing the police, for that Board to have outlined to you either long-term or immediate priorities or rankings of objectives to accomplish with your available resources?",27-205-10,205,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-205-15,There are a number of different models of governance that are often employed by police service boards. One of them is through policies and priorities. I believe it's called the Carver model.,27-205-17,205,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER WILLIAM BLAIR,minister william blair
27-205-19,"Actually, slow down for the reporter. The what model?",27-205-21,205,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-205-21,"The Carver model. I've actually spent a lot of time --I also felt it was my responsibility to help my Board be a good Board because they would help me be a good chief. And so we spent a lot of time talking about how they could do their job and it would help me do my job as a Board, and I think it was a very effective relationship. They did set priorities for the service. They also set my budget. I would collaborate with them and work very closely with them, and they would consult with the public on what those priorities should be, because there is a bridge that a governance body can serve or a police service to be that connection on behalf of community. And so they would bring -- there was lots of community deputations made at our Board meetings where people would outline their expectations and their concerns, and the Board would set priorities, but my Board was also very careful not to cross a line into operational matters, to suggest where we should deploy people or you know, what investigations or what laws would be in force. They never went there, and neither would, frankly, I'd allow them. I'd have pushed back on that. But they often talked about, you know, placing a greater emphasis on community policing, on community outreach, on building greater diversity within the police service, and you know, how we interact with the incredible diverse population of our city and in issues of crime prevention and how communities were to be policed. And frankly, I never considered those infringements on police operations. I just thought it was -- we were working together to do good policing.",27-205-23,205,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER WILLIAM BLAIR,minister william blair
27-206-23,"And what about when that effort at direction from the Police Services Board was aimed at a more immediate situation, and I don’t mean a particular investigation or anything of that type, but for example, if the Tamil protest had shut down University Avenue for four days, would you have considered it out of line for the Police Services Board to ask you what you intended to do about it and express to you their view that they considered this a serious problem for the city?",27-206-25,206,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-207-04,"I would have considered it entirely appropriate. Frankly, I recall getting these questions from the Board, ""What are you doing? Why are you doing it?"" There was a fair bit of criticism, as you can imagine. As a matter of fact, some of the national papers were accusing me of being overly tolerant. My Board was very supportive of what we were doing, but they did ask questions about what and why, which I considered entirely appropriate. But at no time did they tell me how to police that community, and I think that’s -- for me, there is a bright line there, and they didn’t cross that line, but they held me to account to the decisions I was making on how I was going to deliver policing services in those circumstances. And I didn’t consider their questions infringements on any aspect of my authority of responsibility. It was my job to answer their questions and to allow them to perform that oversight role and to hold me accountable for the decisions I made.",27-207-06,207,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER WILLIAM BLAIR,minister william blair
27-207-23,"That’s very helpful. Now, I'm going to ask you to see if you can direct those thoughts to the -- I don't know if unique is the right word -- but at least the different situation of the RCMP which doesn’t have a police services board structure to which it is accountable. The Commissioner reports to the Minister and has a relatively thin statutory framework that delineates that relationship. Have you had some thoughts about what you're calling governance of the RCMP could and should look like if it's different than it currently is now?",27-207-25,207,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-208-06,"Yes, sir. And in fact, it actually appeared in my mandate letter when I was the Minister of Public Safety that we were looking at the issue of governance. It's also -- I also had some responsibility -- I have a keen interest in the delivery of First Nations policing program across the city, and we're working towards the development of a new legislative framework for a First Nations policing in Canada. In order to make sure that that’s as effective as it can be, I believe we have to resolve the issue of governance in those communities, give people a say in how they're going to be policed. That doesn’t mean they get to direct the police operations, but they can talk -- they can make decisions about how the police will function within their communities. And I would also make the observation in a number of jurisdictions across the country, you know, we sometimes see the tension that exists for the contract policing across this country, but very often it's an issue of governance. And I'll just cite, if I may, I also recall vividly in Ontario, there were a number of police -- or communities that had their own little small police services who made a decision to go and contract with the Ontario Provincial Police to deliver policing services in their community. And I witnessed the OPP make a very strong effort to give those communities governance authority over their detachment and to meet regularly with the local officials and to actually give them a say in how they were going to be policed. I thought it was very thoughtful and I also believe that model, which I'm familiar with Ontario, could assist us in improving the quality of policing right across the country, particularly in contract areas, and in particular in First Nations.",27-208-08,208,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-210-03,"Right. Now, there were a couple of times -- and you might remember them -- I'm going to bring you to one in particular -- where you made comments to the effect of the police just need to do their job. In other words, you made comments that gave the public the impression that you didn’t think the police were doing as much as they could to deal with the situations in both Ottawa and elsewhere in the country. And the Ottawa ones, I think you're familiar with, and we've heard a lot from the OPS about their reaction to your comments, so let me just begin there. Did you have the impression that the Ottawa Police were not doing as much as they could or should have or perhaps as early as they should have to deal with the situation that they encountered when the convoy arrived in Ottawa?",27-210-05,210,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-210-21,"Was incorrect. I think -- and based on the intelligence that they had, I think allowing those trucks into the downtown core to establish themselves and become essentially very large barricades, in hindsight -- and I appreciate this is the clarity of my hindsight -- but I believe that was a mistake. And I think they would acknowledge that it would be better had that not happened. But once that actually happened, they were dealing with what, in my experience would be unique circumstances, a uniquely challenging set of circumstances, which was extremely challenging. And in fairness to them, my concern and the statements I have made, frankly, it was not my intention to criticize the police. It was to encourage them to utilize the tools that were available to them, because again, I spent most of my life telling police officers to do their job, and I have every confidence in them. I'm very proud of my profession and I'm very proud of the men and women who do that work, and I was just trying to encourage them. We as a society needed the police because they're the only ones empowered to deal with these Public Order events and we needed them to do their -- to do what was required to bring it to a peaceful resolution. And I was simply commenting that we needed them to do that job.",27-210-23,210,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MINISTER WILLIAM BLAIR,minister william blair

And of course, you can see the words that caught our attention when your office sent the Commission this document among all the others, and that is your comment, ""The police are finally doing their job in Windsor."" And we'll go on to the next paragraph in a second.

27-212-02,"And again, not something I would have ever said to the police because I don't believe that would have been appropriate, but personally I believe that the impact of the blockades at the Ambassador Bridge were being hugely impactful, not just economically, but, you know, auto plants were being shut down right across the province. It was a huge impact that was taking place. People were being laid off, they were being sent home, factory floors were being idled. And I believed there was a sense of urgency to resolve that. I respect, you know, the operational commanders. I wasn't second-guessing them, certainly to them, but I was, frankly, relieved that they were, in my opinion, finally resolving that. I also had every expectation, as I indicated in that note, that they would do everything to avoid violence, that they would be measured and proportional and professional because I know those guys, and I have every confidence in their work. But I was very much seized with a strong sense of urgency about the blockades at that particular location because I believe that they had been so impactful.",27-212-04,212,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And it -- can you just, to those who haven't followed the proceedings quite as closely maybe as the rest of us, can you just outline what that was about and how it came across your desk?",27-213-19,213,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-213-23,"Yes, sir. And I don't recall precisely whether the letter arrived first or I heard from Deputy Minister Stewart, but I became aware that there was a request from the Province of Alberta, and I believe it was from Minister Rick McIver, stating a number of things about what was transpiring in Alberta with respect to the Coutts blockade. The Coutts blockade had been going on for some time. And among the things that Minister McIver was asking for, he made a number of comments, but his primary ask was for access, and he was very specific to Canadian Armed Forces tow trucks, I believe, in order to assist in the movement of trucks that were blockading the highway in southern Alberta at Coutts. And so immediately, because he was asking for Canadian Armed Forces resources and personnel in order to respond to this, that request I forwarded to the Department of National Defence and to Minister Annand because it didn't fall under any of our existing agreements. So it would have been something that, first of all, we'd have to hear from the Canadian Armed Forces whether or not they had equipment fit for purpose, and would also require the approval of the Minister of National Defence. And so that information went on over to them. I also recall a number of days later being advised by Deputy Minister Stewart that the Canadian Armed Forces advised that they did not have equipment fit for purpose and didn't believe that they would be able to respond to that request. The advice I received from the Deputy Minister at that time is that we should simply advise Alberta that we weren't able to respond positively for their request for assistance. We always endeavour to try to do our best, but there have been a few occasions where we've had to say no, we just don't have that equipment. But I did ask the Deputy Minister and some of my own staff to explore, again, from a whole Government standpoint, did we have any other resources that we can draw upon, I was very reluctant to just say no. And so we looked at other departments and agencies, Parks Canada, Transport Canada, I even had people checking to see if we could access trucks from the United States that could have been brought across the border to assist, and ultimately, I was advised no, and that they weren't able to do that. I then asked, because Minister McIver had called me and wanted an answer to the question, and I said to my people, ""we have to have a formal response to Minister McIver."" A letter was produced, I approved it. I was concerned that, again, we were saying no, but I approved it. Also making an offer because he had indicated that they were going to purchase some of their own vehicles at that point in time, that we, the Federal Government, would assist in paying for those vehicles. And eventually a letter was approved and I signed off on it thereafter, it goes back to officials to be sent. I understand in my subsequent messaging with Minister McIver that he never received that letter. I have no explanation for that.",27-213-25,213,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

So Mr. Clerk, could you call up SSM.CAN.NSC.00002689. And if the system is working, this will be the unredacted version of a document that has been redacted to the parties until just about right now. And you can see, that there's a -- we're at February 11th here at this exchange of emails, and the email we're looking at right now is from Ms. Astravas, and she's recording that the PMO has approved, and this, we're going to find out when we go down here, is followed by an email from you. And I'll suggest to you you might recognise it, but you're commenting here on the response to Alberta, and if I have got that right, what you're saying is, ""It's a weak response"", that is, the response you or the Federal Government is giving to Alberta: ""It's a weak response but all we have. I approve. Please advise Alberta.""

GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-220-17,"Yes, sir, if I may, the situation in Ottawa had been enormously challenging for the people of Ottawa. And I think people were living in a state of fearfulness and intimidation and, frankly, I think it was a very difficult set of circumstances for them there. And I was aware of that, and, you know, obviously, anxious to resolve that, but I remained hopeful throughout, and I'd like to also sort of be clear to characterize I believe very much the Emergency Act was a measure of last resort, and that it was incumbent upon us to, first of all, either exhaust all existing authorities, or acknowledge that they would not be successful and could not be used for a number of different reasons. And we were hearing that type of feedback from law enforcement about the enormous challenges they were facing. We were also hearing about how stretched their resources were being pulled because of events that were taking place in different parts of the country that required them to respond to one place but then be required in other places. And that was a challenge that we were hearing quite frequently as well. But I will also tell you I became very concerned, because one of my responsibilities as the Minister for Emergency Preparedness is the resiliency and safety and security of critical infrastructure. And we define critical infrastructure as 10 different sectors of critical infrastructure. And in particular as it relates to this event, it includes such things as manufacturing, our transportation routes, essential supply lines, the movement of essential workers. And what I was witnessing at the Ambassador Bridge, at Coutts, at Emerson, and then in a number of different venues that I would -- where we would see similar activity being threatened to be done at Point Edwards, at the Peace Bridge, on the Pacific Highway in British Columbia that that escalation, and I viewed it as a significant escalation, because it did result in significant disruption of critical supply lines, the cutting off of essential goods and services, of the impact it was having not just economically but on people, on families and, you know, the people who were being laid off their jobs and factories were being idle. I was also concerned because I'm aware, being a person from Ontario, that the integrated manufacturing processes in Ontario, particularly in the auto sector, but in many other manufacturing sectors as well, you know, prior to being Public Safety Minister, I was also the Minister of Border Security. And so it really did give me an understanding and appreciation of how important the integrity and functioning of that border is to our prosperity, to our economy, and to the wellbeing and health and safety of Canadians. And so when those borders were essentially closed, and that, you know, the movement of goods and services, some of the parts that go into our factories was being essentially stopped, it was hugely impactful. And I believe that it had risen to the level of an actual emergency. We were also seeing -- frankly, the information that we received from the RCMP on or around February 10th that they believed that there were firearms present at Coutts, and then subsequently I believe on the 13th and 14th when they completed their criminal investigation and arrested people and seized a number of firearms, it also, for me, elevated concern about public safety, and the risk that, not everyone involved in these protests represented, but embedded within these protests the possibility, certainly in Alberta, of violence and even serious violence taking place. And so for me, that -- the impact that it was having not just in the City of Ottawa but I don't want to minimize what was going on in Ottawa by any stretch of the imagination, but right across the country, particularly as it pertains to critical infrastructure, for me, elevated the situation to a national emergency. I would also observe as well, I believed that, you know, there was strong evidence that what was -- the fact that this protest was so well entrenched in blockades in Ottawa really anchored what was taking place right across the country. There was, in my mind, a clear correlation between the activities of border blockades and what was taking place in Ottawa. And it also, for me, highlighted the need, we had to resolve the whole situation, and failure to do so would have -- and failure to resolve in Ottawa would have resulted, just continued to, like, whack-a-mole, chasing border blockades at one port of entry to another. There are 119 border points of entry, land border points of entry in this country, plus our airports. And all of them are vulnerable to this type of unlawful action, and in my opinion, that represented a serious threat to our national security and became a national emergency.",27-220-19,220,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And if I can remind you, you had a fourth -- believe it or not, you just did go through three of your factors; they sort of got lumped together, but your fourth had to do with your view on whether or not the existing legal authorities were adequate, whether they had been exhausted, et cetera. What was your view there?",27-224-15,224,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
27-224-19,"Yes, sir. One of the things that -- I can go through a bit of a list. One of the things we heard in Alberta, in Manitoba, in British Columbia, and certainly in Ottawa and at the Ambassador Bridge, was the very significant challenges that police were having in gaining access to vehicles that they could tow the large trucks that were being used basically to blockade. You know, they ceased to be trucks; they were fortresses, and very, very difficult to move. There were a number of reasons why, that I think have been articulated for this Commission as to why they couldn’t gain access to those, but it was a reality that they could not. I looked very carefully, by the way, on Friday when Ontario brought in their measures, they did attempt to address making those tow trucks available, at least in Ontario, but you know, it only authorized the use of the truck, it did not compel it. And so I was concerned that given the circumstances and what I believe to be the reasons why those trucks weren’t available to the police to clear the blockades, either at Ambassador Bridge or in Ottawa, that we needed to do something else. I’m also aware -- in a previous part of my police career, I was very much involved in organized crime and money laundering investigations, and so I am familiar with the authorities and the activities of FINTRAC, and one of the questions that, you know, we had as a government was, you know, where is this money coming from and how is it being used? I became aware that FINTRAC did not have existing authorities to provide us with that information. And so that was, in my opinion, a deficiency in existing authorities and something that we needed to consider how we might be able to address it. There were also a number of areas -- like one of the things, Ambassador Bridge, as an example, was blockaded. One of the first things I did is a dug out the International Bridges and Tunnels Act to see what authorities we had, but the authorities within that Act were limited only to the bridge. And as you’ll recall, the blockade’s in Windsor; it didn’t set up on the bridge or even in their primary points of access, it was further down the road. It was very effective in closing down that bridge, but it happened to be on a municipal roadway, which is governed by municipal bylaw and the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, but not really effectively by any federal statute. And so the ability to designate certain spaces, that also became relevant in the City of Ottawa, I think, for Wellington Street and the Sir John A. Parkway in order to -- it became necessary to designate certain spaces where those activities would not be prohibited. And so there were a number of circumstances where the normal tools that police would rely on, either in municipal statute, in provincial statute -- municipal bylaw, provincial statute, or in federal statute were not being able -- they could not use them effectively to resolve this in a peaceful way. And, you know, we listened very carefully to the challenges that we were facing, and I came to believe that we needed to find a remedy to provide them with the tools that they required in order to effect the purpose of bringing these protests to an end.",27-224-21,224,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

27-226-20,"Okay. And coming to the end of our time and to the end of the part of the story that the Commission hopes to have you talk about; you observed, not as a police participant but as an experienced Public Order Commander, the enforcement action that eventually came to pass in Ottawa when the plan -- the joint forces plan was implemented.

They moved slowly, methodically, respectfully. You know, it was very clear that they were well-trained; very clear they were well-read. I believe that their exercise of the authorities that they had, both in existing law and in the new regulations, was done in a very measured and careful way. And I’ve seen some video of how they’ve done it; it’s textbook. And I’ve been trained as a Public Order Commander and I’ve seen it done well and I’ve never seen it done better than what I witnessed here in the City of Ottawa as they, I think, to the extent possible, as peacefully as possible, brought this to a resolution. They allowed people, for example, points of egress. It’s always important to let people have a space to go. They did that work. They moved slowly. I actually found myself trying to explain to some of my friends that -- why they’re going slowly, because that’s the right way to do it.

It is an insult to memory and truth. Hate can never be the answer.’ Over the past few days, Canadians were shocked and frankly disgusted by the behaviour displayed by some people protesting in the Nation’s Capital. I want to be very clear; we are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless. We won’t give in to those who fly racist flags. We won’t cave to those who engage in vandalism and dishonour the memory of our veterans. There is no place in our country for threats, violence, or hatred. So to those responsible for this behaviour, it needs to stop. To anyone who joined the convoy but is rightly uncomfortable with the symbols of hatred and division on display, join with your fellow Canadians. Be courageous and speak out.

One of the things that we had heard from a number of jurisdictions is the difficulty in compelling tow trucks to come to provide assistance. I looked at the Ontario regulations and, although it allowed for those tow trucks, it didn’t compel. And we were a little bit concerned about its limitations. There was also nothing in there, as I recall, that dealt with some of the real challenges we had in tracing the financial elements of this in the crowdfunding, who was donating that money, where it was going, and so we believed that there was a need to address that. How we eventually got there, there was still considerable deliberations going on but, again, the limitations of the federal statute -- and they also did not have the ability to designate certain spaces where -- which was a concern as well because, you know, we were concerned they were concentrating, for example, on Wellington. I was very concerned about their ability to go back to a municipal intersection just off the Ambassador Bridge. And so we looked at whether or not the Ontario regulations provided us with adequate assurance that those matters could be dealt with.

First of all, there was an expansion in some of the protest activity that was taking place in Ottawa. I was hearing very clearly how concerned the people of Ottawa were about that -- not just the activity that was taking place but that it appeared to become even more entrenched. There was also a lot of public discourse and particularly in Ottawa but in other places as well about people losing confidence in the police, and trust and confidence in the police is absolutely essential for them to do their job. And so I was very concerned about the impact that the apparent ineffectiveness of the police to deal with this was causing in the public’s confidence in their competence and their ability to resolve this. And finally, one of the things that we were also hearing, a lot of people were very confused about who is responsible for policing in the City of Ottawa. And, you know, for most people, they don’t differentiate between the responsibilities of different orders of government. And what I was also hearing is that many people assumed that the federal government was responsible for this, and my comment is -- was that I knew it was primarily the provincial responsibility, the province’s responsibility under their Police Services Act to take certain steps, and I was hoping that they would take those steps. And, by the way, subsequently, on, I believe, December 11th, they did in fact pass their own Emergencies Act and introduce regulations on the 12th.",27-327-19,327,19,17,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

So the IRG on the 13th, and then there’s a cabinet meeting the night of the 13th as well, and then the following morning is when there's the First Minister's meeting and the Act is invoked. But we know that the morning or overnight leading into the 14th the blockade at Coutts was dealt with and arrests were made, and the Ambassador Bridge, I believe, had also been cleared. Is there anything that could have happened between the 13th and the 14th that in your view would have caused the Government or should have caused the Government to pause and say perhaps we don't need to take this nuclear option that we're about to take?",27-328-19,328,19,17,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

27-329-02,"Well, think of the question. I want to be very clear, we approach, and certainly my approach to this, but I believe an approach shared by my colleagues and the Prime Minister, we approached the invocation of the Emergency Act with great caution, with real reluctance. We saw it as a last resort. And we were prepared to do what was required but only if required and only for as long as was required. And so throughout all of our deliberations, there was that concern. You asked what circumstances might have enabled us to say we're done. If we'd been able to receive some assurances, but, you know, the blockade at Coutts had gone on for almost I think 13 days. Its resolution was not as a result of the, you know, the towing away of those trucks with people deciding to leave. It was as a direct result of an RCMP investigation where several people were arrested, charged with very serious criminal offences and seizure of quite a number of weapons, and then they moved very quickly. We still had significant blockades at Emerson. We were seeing them at the Pacific Highway. Although the Ambassador Bridge had been reopened, there was lots of intelligence suggesting that they would return. Police were telling us they had the ability to clear it but not the ability to hold it. And we were hearing of an intention to go to Point Edwards Bridge at Sarnia, to go to the Peace Bridge, to go to other bridges, all of which would have had a similar effect of significantly impacting Canadians and Canadian interest. And so we were still dealing with a set of circumstances where, although, yes, some very positive things had happened at Coutts and at Windsor, the threat that existed had not yet abated, and we were still dealing with that.",27-329-04,329,4,2,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

You have testified that, in your view, reliance upon the Emergencies Act was a matter of last resort, and I'm going to pick up on that theme; okay? When Commission Counsel asked you questions, which now probably feels like some time ago, he asked you questions about why there was -- about mistrust between, as I understood it, police agencies. He used the phrase ships passing in the night. He in a question suggests there was confusion and disagreement about what -- who goes where and does what. Your answer to that was in reference to governance. But my question is, as you look back today, to what extent do you believe that better communications or effective communications between police agencies and within police agencies might have avoided the need for resort upon the Emergencies Act?",27-330-11,330,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

What we were also dealing with however in government was the reality that that communication perhaps had not been as effective and, as a result of, you know -- and again, it's not my job here to assess responsibility, but the reality was, this had persisted for a very long time. In many respects, it had gotten more difficult and dangerous, and we were concerned that it had to be resolved. And so, you know, I'm in complete agreement that good communications within police services and between police services, and I would also add between those governance bodies responsible for policing and the public, those communication's really critically important on all aspects of this. But in the event that that had not been as effective as perhaps we would have preferred or wanted it to be, we were dealing with a situation that was uniquely challenging and required, unfortunately, and my opinion, an extraordinary response.",27-330-29,330,29,27,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

And so one of my responsibilities is to look at every legal authority. I've already mentioned, for example, at Windsor, we looked at the International Bridges and Tunnels Act to see if there was any application that that would assist us with. And what we found in the unique and challenging circumstances that police and communities were confronted with as a result of these blockades, there were, I think, a need to additional tools and authorities to enable them to affect the important lawful purpose of restoring the peace.",27-331-24,331,24,22,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

And for example, there was a very real concern being expressed by citizens about people bringing jerry cans full of gasoline into the demonstration site. It is rather unusual. I will tell you for, you know, inflammable liquids, potentially explosive liquids being brought into a demonstration site, it can create a manifestly dangerous situation. And so the police had said they were not going to allow it, but what we then witnessed is all sorts of people were coming into the site carrying jerry cans, some of which had water, some of which may have had a fluid, but it had the effect of thwarting the ability of the police to effect the purpose that they had stated that was their intention to keep those gas cans out of the area.

The law-abiding citizens, they stop using public space, they stop shopping on their main streets, you know, they stay in their houses, lock their doors, put bars on the windows, and they're fearful of going outside and engaging with each other.

There was also other activities on other highways, 402, for example, all of which had the effect of really pulling and stretching the capacity to respond of the OPP and their policing partners in Ontario. We also saw, for example, as a result of the Coutts blockade there was an Article 9 request from the Province of Alberta to move additional RCMP officers into Alberta to assist with managing that particular event. They were drawn primarily from British Columbia, but then we saw almost immediately there was protest and blockade activity taking place at Pacific Highway. So the place from which those resources had been drawn was then being challenged, and it appeared to be an effort to stretch even thinner limited police resources.

And, you know, clearly, the police were -- had adequate resources and a clear plan and were moving people out. I was particularly impressed as I watched that, that the protesters were given passive egress, so that they could leave, and that's really important when you're trying to clear a street that you give people a reasonable point of exit from that street. The other thing that I would observe is the presence of those vehicles. I think even as I watch this, the police were dealing with a unique challenge because those vehicles were, in many cases, still present in that event. And but I thought the way in which they managed the movement of those people was entirely proportionate -- and I looked very carefully.

They do tier 1 investigations; they do money laundering; they head up the Integrated National Security Enforcement teams. Like, those are very important RCMP responsibilities.

And I guess to use a concrete example, is it appropriate, in your view -- or could it be that the board or the Solicitor General give -- indicate its priority? And to use a specific, would it be improper for the Solicitor General of Ontario to have said, “There are big problems in Ottawa and in Windsor. Our view is Windsor’s more important.

I understand their motivation but I was concerned it had the effect of potentially giving permission for those trucks to remain on Wellington and Sir John A., which I think could have been problematic. I was also very mindful of the challenge that Windsor had experienced because this had taken place in a municipal intersection and our ability to designate that space, because of its, I think, significant impact and vulnerability for critical infrastructure, that we needed to go beyond simply the tools of a municipal bylaw and potentially take a more proactive stance with respect to that. I am, of course, familiar with the common law authorities. Part of the challenges in common law authorities is they’re not always clearly understood or articulated.

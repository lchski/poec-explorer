08-012-03,"So that was something that we had identified and that Chief Sloly had identified as a need for us moving ahead was how Intelligence and Information work together. So we had a large project underway at that time which was around intelligence-led policing to look at how we most effectively gather, analyse, and share information through the organisation. So they work together very effectively, but the goal of the ILP project, as we named it, was actually to identify how we can refine that sharing of information even more to make sure the information we're bringing into the organisation is shared as broadly and effectively as it could be. We had been involved in that project for probably over a year, and I can say that there were steps and there were efficiencies and improvements that had been found in terms of information-sharing.",08-012-05,12,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-013-16,"So letâs turn our mind back to around January-February of this year.

Specifically to the Freedom Convoy and the events around that, that was flagged, as you say, through a Hendon Report around January 13th.

Thereâs nothing around the information that identifies the activities of the protestors when they actually arrive in the city. Thereâs nothing that indicates that the protestors are going to use the citizens of our community as the leverage point to have their voices heard. In Ottawa, we manage multiple protests on a yearly basis. Weâve managed protests similar to this on previous times.

08-020-28,"Right. Now, if we go to the next page and we look at the third bullet. So the author is here saying that: âIn 6 years of working large demonstration events from the intelligence point of view, the writer has never seen such widespread community action, which means three things for plannersâ¦â Now the third thing is redacted, but we can look at the first two. âthe event is likely going to be bigger in crowd size than any demo in recent history, possibly on par with Canada Day events but more disruptive.â Second: âThere is significant popular support for this event on a scale not seen in recent years. This means the protest groups have access to larger protestor pools than they have ever had access to, which means there will be likely widespread disorganization and confusion.â Now, so the author seems to be warning here of something quite unprecedented, at least compared to recent experience.

FRANK AU,MR. FRANK AU,frank au
08-022-03,"Well I would agree with that. And I would say that all of the intelligence and intelligence gathering that weâd had prior to that indicated a very similar fact. This group had only come on the intelligence radar in late summer of 2021 and never actually materialized. They -- as they moved across the country, they seemed to build support. But they seemed to build grass roots support and all the activities that we had seen them engage in prior to that had been very lawful, had been very pro-social. The amount of people that were supporting them, from my perspective, actually gave it more credibility that it was a grassroots initiative, not that we were going to see the violence that we saw in our streets.",08-022-05,22,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-022-17,"Right. And thereâs nothing here to suggest anything other than a lawful protest. But the author is pointing to the significant number and the likelihood of this organization, or at least the, if not likely -- well, there would be likely widespread disorganization and confusion. Now, if we go on to the paragraph underneath the third redacted point: âThe demographic of the Convoy is very unusual; the protests globally are made up almost entirely of middle-class members of society. Since the so-called; silent majorityâ is numerically much larger than the professional activists. As a result, law enforcement is being met with numbers of people beyond the norm.â So it just reinforces the theme that weâve been on; right?",08-022-19,22,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-023-06,"Thatâs correct, but I donât know that the numbers of people who attended, from a pedestrian, or from a protest perspective, were unmanageable or were had any sort of -- we had any sort of consideration about the activities that they would be involved in. Numbers on their own are something that we have managed in the past at different scales. This was large. This was unprecedented. Everyone realized it was unprecedented. But for us as a policing organization, what pushed it over the top was the activities that the people protesting were engaged in and the harm that they did to our community. A large protest that was lawful could have been managed, would have been managed. It was what was anticipated. The activities engaged in were never clearly identified.

So -- and much of that information would've been gathered through the ongoing Hendon reports. So the ongoing Hendon reports, and the analysis of that, and more, formulated the overall Threat Assessment, that would've helped to support this, but there was also on-the-ground regular dialogue about the incoming information that was contained or not contained, as we've had discussions about in -- to help formulate this threat assessment.",08-029-22,29,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Such equipment could be used to facilitate or secure access to strategic operational positions in Ottawa.

We identified thisâ this was one of the early areas that I identified as a concern. So as a result of that, through discussion with Supt. Patterson, Intelligence was -- worked with the operational branch to actually start to look at this, look at the existence. By this point, this is on the 27th, people are coming across and there are police resources -- specifically in this case, I believe, OPP -- who are with the convoy participants. The follow-up that we received from that was that the PLT, the Police Liaison Team, who weâve heard about through these hearings as well, engaged with them and there was understanding that that heavy equipment would not be taken into the downtown core. There was also understanding through the information we received back that many of the pieces of equipment that were seen were fluid within the convoy. It appears, and as we understood, as it came across Canada, the numbers fluctuated up and down on a regular, daily, almost hourly basis. Some of the equipment that was seen in here was people that in different locations had joined in, I would imagine or speculate that it was, so that they could identify that they were part of this, and didnât continue with the convoy as it came across. As result of this information, plans were put in place to make sure that we diverted heavy equipment like this from the downtown core. But discussions were had with the people who had this, and from my understanding -- and it will be a question better posed to Insp. Lucas, but from my understanding, all of the equipment identified in here or any other trailer-based equipment, never made it into the red zone footprint.

08-038-11,"Sorry, I think thatâs an inference we would now make, but I think itâs important to identify that they did drive across the country. The numbers ebbed and flowed. As they moved across the country, there was police agencies engaged with them on an ongoing basis. Their behaviour, as itâs described within the intelligence reports, and reports we had back, was that they were extremely lawful, that they were engaged in -- there was no anti-social behaviour that they were engaged in. And that was the observations for a number of days. Beyond that, the organizers clearly stated on many occasions, and throughout the Hendon reports, that their intention was to be lawful and peaceful once they came to our city. So regardless of whether the number would have -- whether the number that would have remained would have been smaller, as we anticipated it could have been, it was -- again, it was the activities that occurred here that were the most problematic. We, in our police service, manage many, many protests a year. Some of them are prolonged. Some of them are protracted. Weâve had examples of occupations of parks, of occupations of intersections that have gone on for a longer period of time. But those didnât engage in the unlawful activity that we saw here.

That -- what you described though was not what occurred in our city.

08-043-27,"-- the 26th. The 26th. No. So in answer to your question, absolutely we were all taking an active interest, and I think it's important to note here that the information received by the Chief was funnelled to our Intelligence Unit and our Joint Intelligence Unit for assessment. The Hendon reports on these days, on the 26th, would reflect that there was no anticipated violence to occur. So we were continually briefing on the violence picture and making sure that all of this information was funnelled in to our Intelligence Unit and then into our Planning Team. It makes specific reference to activities or actions that could occur at Rideau Hall. We did look into that. It raises a national security issue, and I can tell you that there was national security representatives, including CSIS and the RCMP, in our Joint Intelligence Group. So again, this was information that was taken in, assessed, evaluated, put towards our threat assessment, and ultimately this didn't bore -- bear out to be accurate.

08-048-11,"No, I don't believe that they were speaking to a prolonged occupation because as I indicated, based on our experience, which was limited, and our assessment, there was a low risk of the convoy in large numbers staying beyond the weekend. But I think that's another area that's very important to highlight. Superintendent Morris identified that this group grew and tried to mobilise over the fall, and actually never did mobilise. They galvanised for the ultimate convoy that occurred. In normal circumstances with Intelligence, one of the things that you rely on in your assessment of it is experience. This group had not existed before. Nobody had any experience in terms of what they were going to do and how they were going to position themselves. And I'll give you an example of where experience is important to us. We have a yearly demonstration at one of our embassies that has gone on for a number of years. We infrequently have high levels of intelligence around any activity in that area, yet we continually create a large deployment footprint between ourselves and the RCMP because we have the experience that it -- that violence has occurred there and there is the potential for violence occurring. The same could be said about the Panda Game Homecoming. There is little intelligence that comes out, yet we create deployment plans around experience. Nobody had ever experienced this group coming into an area. Ottawa on the 28th of January was the first experience in that. So I do know that following this there was -- there has been extensive changes internally, and people have seen a definitive change in our response based on our experience, but across the country, police leaders identified that they now had a scope of what their experience could anticipate it to be with this group. Before they arrived on the 28th, we had no experience, and all of the experience as they moved across was that they were lawful, and that they indicated they were coming to lawfully protest in Ottawa. That experience package changed for us on the 28th.",08-048-13,48,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell

So let me take you to one email, one chain of email. OPS00014930. First of all, do you know of which I'm speaking, the Hotel Association was in touch with the City of Ottawa, and I believe that information was transferred to the OPS.

08-051-13,"So it's an extremely good example of that. And I can tell you we did receive this information from Mr. Ball through Mr. Gravel. I believe it went into our Emergency Operations Centre, where it was put into the Intelligence Group to follow up. As a result, a member of our Police Liaison Team contacted Mr. Ball, and what initially was identified as a large tract of people who were going to be in the city for many, many days was narrowed down to being, no, it's a smaller group of people who have booked a three-day stay. So one of the -- the challenging thing for us is this was information that helped contribute to our view that it was going to be a -- largely a three-day protest.",08-051-15,51,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-051-25,"Right. Now so everyone's trying to figure out to the best they can what's going to happen, and this Commission has heard from Ms. Carrier, for instance, a week or so ago. I've referenced this when I examined Deputy Chief Ferguson last week, so I'll put that to you again, because Ms. Carrier, who was a businesswoman, a layperson with no access to any police intelligence, just based on her observation, you know, she said -- if I could find the transcript. She said, ""To me personally, it was clear that the 70-kilometre train of trucks that crossed the country was not coming in for a small protest in a day. And to me, that Sunday night was the proof that, you know, somebody somewhere had underestimated or not listened to the anger, frustration that a large, at [this] point, you know, large number of people felt. They were coming to the City of Ottawa as the representatives of what they thought and they were going to stay there. They were going to stay there until they were heard."" So entirely apart from Intelligence reports and so on, there was this common-sense inference that some people draw, that people are not going to drive all the way from the west with all of these, you know, emotions that the Intelligence reports also refers to, to only stay for a full weekend. So in terms of contingency planning, what role did Intelligence have to inform that contingency planning?",08-051-27,51,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
08-052-26,"So I think Intelligence would have played an important role, and to try and highlight the risks that they knew at the time. And I believe that that was done. It became more possible, as was identified, that a small group of people could continue beyond the weekend, but then mainly it was being planned around a weekend protest. All of the activities that we took, including this one with the Hotel Association, led us to believe that that's what it was. The intelligence, as we read it, talks about a large protest, but the numbers that are necessary for planning didn't start to come in until the day before and that -- please don't hear that as a fault of anyone. It was just very difficult because of how fluid and dynamic the situation was for us to be able to gather, through our partners, real-time intelligence. So Intelligence continually stayed on, continually fed the planning team of what they knew at the time with the best information. As you described it though, it was a fluid week. It was a rollercoaster that week in terms of information coming out and refining down. And ultimately, the numbers, the size of it weren't fully refined until the 29th and the 30th when it was already upon us. And I'll go back to it again because I don't think it can be understated. The real impact of this protest was the community harm that was created. That was what the problem and the consequence to our community was through the activities of these protesters. There wasn't any information that identified that. And that, for me, is what created the need, the emerging need for us to make sure that we have the action plans in place as we saw that emerge. Our community were dramatically exposed to violent activity over that period of time.",08-052-28,52,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-054-01,"Now this may be open to debate, but one may argue that the combination of the large number of people in trucks with the expression of an intent to stay for some time until the mandates are lifted logically lead to, you know, this risk of social trauma, if large number are going to stay here for a long time; do you agree?",08-054-03,54,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

The experience we had until this point was they were -- we were exactly right. They were people moving across the country determined to be heard, but they were peaceful, and they indicated that their intention was to be peaceful when they got here. That isn't what materialized and that isn't what caused the consequence to our city. People protesting in an area lawfully is something we can manage and handle. People creating an occupation that traumatizes our community was something that no community had ever seen, is -- was unprecedented, and was the situation we're facing when we began to get the experience of these people.",08-054-09,54,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
08-056-27,"So first I'd like to start with thank you very much. I'm very happy that that's one of the areas the Commission's looking at, because I think there are many lessons for us to all learn through this. Some of those lessons, I can tell you, we've already learned and put into practice. In terms of Intelligence, I know that one of the things that we've developed is better capacity and capability around open-source information. What was borne out of this situation was a unit that's been created within our organization specifically dedicated at collecting open-source information and sharing it into Intelligence. I think their -- you know, opportunity around Intelligence is to ensure that Intelligence, Open-source and Police Liaison Team information is more readily shared, so that it can be cross-referenced. We've seen that develop within our organization. I also think, and one of the things we've been able to do is we read the intelligence differently now. We've had multiple subsequent events in this city where we've used our experience to leverage our operational planning. One of those was Rolling Thunder. And when you look at the intelligence, there was the identification that it may not have been a large risk event for us, but we used our experience to apply it towards that intelligence and created a deployment model that actually ultimately did, I believe, prevent a subsequent occupation to our streets. So I think from an Intelligence perspective, the coordination and cooperation and it has always been good between ourselves and our partners, I think this identified that we need to expand that and that we need to broaden the sources of information that we're bringing in and properly leverage them in our operational planning with the experience we have.",08-056-29,56,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-061-08,"Okay. So let's take a look at this opinion. Staying on page 1, if we scroll down. The paragraph that starts with, ""While the convoy"", if we could go up. Yeah, that's good: ""While the convoy has not yet reached the City of Ottawa, various considerations will need to be assessed and reassessed to determine the appropriate response, including: the balancing of competing Charter rights; impacts to public enjoyment and the right to mobility; impacts to health and safety; impacts on obstructing emergency vehicles; and impacts to public safety generally."" So I want to ask you, in preparing for response, how did you and your executive team consider these bullets, including the impacts to public enjoyment and the right to mobility, and the last point, impacts to public safety generally?",08-061-10,61,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
08-062-01,"So I think that would've been done by an ongoing assessment that was being conducted by the Planning Team and Intelligence moving ahead. Those areas were specifically impacted, as I indicated, and we only realised that once the convoy arrived. The anticipation of the community trauma and violence to our community that was going -- did occur, wasn't anticipated because nobody saw that coming. Nobody knew that that was going to be the tactic that the mob that got here was going to actually engage in. So that is something that we look at. We look at public safety, we look at Charter of rights and freedoms, and all of these index, but we had never taken the view of making sure that the community and the surrounding areas we were as responsive to their needs. We take that into account more than ever now, and that's what you've seen as we have responded to Rolling Thunder, responded to Canada Day, to make sure that we interpret our intelligence with our experience, but also make sure that we identify potential hazards or concerns that could occur within the community and put that absolutely front and centre in our planning. The reason I highlight that is the one thing that I hear consistently after the removal of the occupation, and very rightfully, is that we didn't put enough emphasis as a police service on our community and the impact that it caused to them in the very early days, that they felt that we didn't focus on the harm that was being done to them. While we have always had that in the planning, I think we need to be overt in it and say, ""Community, these are -- this is your city, these are your streets. We will conduct ourselves in order to protect you within this community and protect you within those streets."" So I think the emphasis that I am playing is that we need to always have Charter rights and freedoms on our mind, we always need to have community safety, but we need to make sure that we bring the community impact to the front of everything we do because it was the area that was most violated during this event.",08-062-03,62,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-063-11,"Now, the opinion talked about the balancing of competing Charter rights, and perhaps many of the residents felt that there was an imbalance. And one of the central question that arose from the planning perspective is about the ability of preventing the trucks from entering the downtown core it the first place. So I want to ask you what was your understanding of the lawful authority for the OPS to prevent the trucks from going downtown and park there that first weekend?",08-063-13,63,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
08-063-20,"So I believe that we do have the ability, and I believe we've exercised it several times since then, to prevent the vehicles from going down. A truck isn't a protected entity under the Charter of rights and freedoms, people are. That is something we had not exercised prior as an organisation. When we had vehicle born demonstrations, protests, or events in what is the downtown core we had always allowed them because our experience was they had come and they had left and we had managed them. And that was a regular occurrence for us, and that happened many, many times, usually many, many times a year. So although the Charter doesn't protect the vehicles, I do know that our experience had been that we would allow those type of vehicles. I think there's another side to it as well that's very important. Particularly as we became closer to the date, we saw the volume of vehicles that were going. They were coming to Ottawa. They were very clear about that, they were coming to Ottawa. So the ability for us to protect and preserve public safety would mean that we would want them to go into a designated area so that we could better control it. We didn't, again, didn't anticipate the activities. We didn't anticipate the size or scope or number of people who stayed because do have to remember most people did leave on Sunday night. So the ability for us to manage the protest and demonstration in a core, as opposed to people coming and have a blocked off downtown core and leaving their trucks on the 417, or trucks dispersed around many different areas, it was going to be more manageable for us in a centralised area.",08-063-22,63,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-064-21,"All right. Now, we asked the same question or a very similar question of Mr. Sloly, the former Chief, and I want to show you his answer and ask you if you agree with him. Can we go to the document WTS00000040, and if you could go to page 15, please. The second paragraph: ""Chief Sloly was advised that based on the known intelligence reports, OPS did not have the legal authority to deny the Freedom Convoy access to downtown Ottawa simply because some people disagreed with the views of some participants. He understood that OPS did have authority to close roads and restrict traffic if there were public safety concerns, but closures and restrictions had to be commensurate to actual threats or reasonably predictable threats. Highway Traffic Act or by-law violations alone would not be sufficient to justify restricting access to the City for all protestors.""

08-066-04,No. We had experience. We had experience in exactly what had occurred.

FRANK AU (Cont'd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
08-066-15,"Absolutely. And I think that that experience that I talk about is something that you saw across the country as people planned and responded to similar incidents. Toronto Police Service and the City of Toronto had a much more successful intervention in a protest in subsequent weekends to what we had initially. And Chief Ramer was being clear in identifying it. Part of that was because of the experience that they saw occur in Ottawa, that they identified different threats in different ways and built a plan around the experience that theyâve seen us -- they saw us endure.",08-066-17,66,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And thatâs -- Rolling Thunder, I would propose that had we not had the experience we had, we wouldnât have planned in the way we did. We wouldnât have had the public order deployment. We wouldnât have had the exclusionary zone. And in that case, the Friday evening that it occurred, we would have had a truck that attempted to occupy an intersection, that was followed quickly by other vehicles, set up and be successful for a period of time in, again, taking over an area of our city.

The paragraph that starts with âthereforeâ. âTherefore, while the case law indicates that those who wish to protest have a - Charter-protected right in doing so, it is not without limits. These limits, as the courts have recognized, prevent threats of violence, acts of violence, and unlawful conduct. Moreover, these limits also prevent demonstrators from obstructing travel on roadways. It is worth nothing, however, that there has been at least one decision where it was found that a blockade for a very brief period only constituted a minor inconvenience and was therefore permissible.â So what this memo is saying here is that there are limits to the Charter and part of the consideration apart from potential threats of violence is the prospect of the demonstrators obstructing travel on roadways.

And they have an expectation on us to be able to appropriately manage and facilitate those protests. So for a large demonstration to come into the downtown core, in and around the seat of Parliament, and protest for a number of days would not be abnormal in this city, even with the traffic disruptions that would occur. What was abnormal in this situation was the volume of vehicles that came and the area that they actually occupied. What was particularly -- and Iâve said it and I will say it again.

08-071-20,"So during that period, several key things occur. So on the 28th, the convoy arrives. We are anticipating a three-day event with the potential of a smaller group of people staying. And thereâs massive numbers. So through the weekend, and I wouldnât be the one to best speak about it, but through the weekend, the event is managed. Sunday night, so I believe thatâs the 30th, we then anticipate most people leaving. Many people left, but we still had a very large red zone, that we identified it, with lots of trucks, with anti-social behaviours that are targeting our community. So we start to then move into the Monday, where weâre seeing an entrenched group who are actively demonstrating, protesting, and targeting our community. During that phase -- so on the 30th, as weâre looking at going into Monday, demobilization planning, as itâs called, is being identified by Deputy Chief Ferguson. So thereâs direction thatâs being put out by Deputy Ferguson. So always a potential of them -- some staying. We have a very large footprint now. What is our -- what are our potentials to actually remove people from this area if we need to go there? So thatâs tasked out on the 30th. So during that week, weâre starting to orient ourselves. So I wasnât present at it, but on the 1st of February, so 31st is Monday, 1st of February is Tuesday, thereâs a meeting that occurs between Deputy Chief Ferguson, Chief Sloly, and the large Public Order Unit commander table to start looking at options for a tactical resolution to this. So that group then is tasked out with coming up with options that could be used. That Public Order team then brings back options to Chief Sloly, myself, Deputy Chief Ferguson, and other senior leaders to identify the three options that they had identified on the 4th of -- on the 4th of February. So that would be -- I believe thatâs the Friday. From that optioning -- optioning solutions that have come out, thereâs three that are identified. The command team has the discussion with them as we go through, weigh all the benefits of each of them. and ultimately, an approach is then identified on the 4th. So that takes us through the first week. So the orientation is figuring out whatâs going on within the environment, making sure, trying to get the resources that we require, or assign the resources that we require to hold the red zone in a safe manner, try and manage public safety issues in the way that we can with the limited capacity we have, as well as then start to develop planning, or at least identify strategic concepts around how weâre going to approach this moving ahead.",08-071-22,71,22,20,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION BY MR.

Although there continued to be dates through Intelligence that we'd received that identified there might be an actual date where the group would pick up and leave, we identified that that may or may not come to fruition, and we needed to start to engage in our planning, engage in the planning to ultimately remove the occupation. So one of the things that we did at the very early outset in a Command Team meeting, I think it was actually at our morning call or at a specific briefing around the convoy, I can't remember which one it was, but we established for the purposes of planning what would be a long window of what we could potentially be looking at for a sustainability perspective. It's an important premise for us in order to look at the window that we are going to need to plan for. This is mainly not to identify when it's going to end, to identify what is the potential that we may need from a staffing perspective from a resource perspective so that we can actually look at planning how we manage our members and other resources coming in. So although we had -- we didn't know what the length of it would be at that time, we identified on the long end a four-week planning period for sustainability so that we know -- we would know we had the resources in place that we needed when we needed them.",08-075-25,75,25,23,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION BY MR.

We do have the ability to close ramps on the street side, but that creates traffic problems and issues. So we could close them but not normally. Interprovincial bridges are a different circumstance. Interprovincial bridges are much more challenging to close, particularly in a preventative way. In exigent circumstances, as things are occurring, they may be closed; and the first weekend, the second weekend, and even in the third weekend, you saw that happen when the threshold for us to do that was met by the operational commanders.

08-087-27,"The Incident Command System has levels within it for very distinct reasons. That's so that you can actually accomplish the operation that you want to with the most clarity, the most understanding, and the most safely way possible. The strategic level needs to actually identify what is the approach that's going to be used, what is the general outcomes that we are looking for. The operational needs to then look at how -- what are the resources, how are we actually going to make that happen. The tactical level then needs to execute on those plans. When somebody engaged at a strategic level began -- begins to give tactical or operational level commands, it creates a lack of clarity in terms of everyone's role within the structure. That lack of clarity then creates questions around what do I do, what is my responsibility within this, do I have to escalate and ask a question of. So the necessity to have that role clarity through it, I believe, is very important, and you have to play your roles through it, because when you don't, you create a lack of understanding, which can impact the operations.",08-087-29,87,29,27,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION BY MR.

08-088-28,"So this is one of the key areas that I believe that we needed to look at when I became Interim Chief in terms of how we continue to progress around this area. In this case, a strategic-level decision could be I don't want the convoys in the downtown area. Go and work how we actually keep those trucks out of the downtown area. An operational-level decision, in my perspective, is close the ramp so convoys don't come into the downtown area. But I think it's also important to note, there is no rigorous system that identifies exactly where each of those thresholds land. And if there is a rigorous system, there is four different accepted systems within Canada that could be used in this area. So it's an area that I believe is something that probably hampered us somewhat in this with the lack of clarity. No fault attributed to anyone, just there was not clear clarity across the services, across ourselves in terms of what constituted each of those decisions. So I believe that that clarity needs to be struck and needs to exist, and that's one of the things that, in the early days of me taking over the operation as Interim Chief, that I spent a considerable amount of time doing. So the people that I was working with, Deputy Chief Ferguson, Superintendent Bernier had a really clear understanding of what I felt was a strategic role and what I felt was an operational level decision.",08-088-30,88,30,28,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION BY MR.

The strategic-level decision here for me is whether we support or not the negotiations, and that was made by Chief Sloly, so I believe it's Superintendent Bernier's responsibility to identify his concerns, raise those concerns, but then when this level of decision is made, look how we operationally and tactically implement that plan.",08-125-21,125,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

It was concerning. The situation at this point was becoming exceptionally more volatile and you could see it escalate almost on an hour-by-hour basis. One of the components that, for me, contributed to wanting to be involved in something like this is negotiations tend to take the temperature of the situation down. That is exactly, in my opinion, what occurred in this circumstance. I will absolutely concede we didnât notify Supt. Bernier early enough, will absolutely say that when it operationally became, you know, unfeasible to do it, Supt. Bernier made the call and that this stopped. But I -- you have to remember the time and place were in and this was becoming -- what was a dangerous city before, this was compounding it.

08-131-15,"Right. Now, in my remaining time, which is not very much, there are a couple of small things I want to cover off. First of all, weâve heard from some of the parties raising the issue as to why ticketing, as a tactic or a strategy, wasnât employed more as a way to deter the protestors from continuing in their illegal activities. Now, ticketing is a bylaw function but we also understand from the evidence that the City Bylaw officers were listening to the OPS as the lead agency for what would or would not be appropriate under the OPS Incident Command. So what can you tell us about this strategy involving ticketing?",08-131-17,131,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (contâd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
08-131-26,"So because that was on the planning and operations side, I wouldnât have been in any direction that would have been provided to Bylaw. That would have come through the incident command -- sorry, the NCRCC, so would probably be a question better directed to Insp. Lucas.",08-131-28,131,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-132-08,"So, more broadly thank ticketing, I can tell you that there was officer-safety concerns due to the number of resources we had in many of the different enforcement strategies that we were looking to engage in. I would put the ticketing in with that as well. So there was -- we were very clear with out members, due to the volatility of the situation within the occupation, ""Make sure you take into account your officer safety if you are engaging in any proactive enforcement efforts.""",08-132-10,132,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-132-17,"All right. Next area -- well, actually, back to one of the areas that we had covered -- I believe you mentioned earlier when I asked you about intelligence that the OPS planning decision was based on intelligence you're familiar with that would suggest that it would be a two-day or a three-day event. Are you able to assist us with any specific document that would lead you to believe that it was a two-or- three-day event?",08-132-19,132,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-133-04,"Now, my understanding from reading those reports when they talked about intelligence gap -- and by the way, you can correct me if I'm wrong -- but intelligence gaps just means we donât know about it, right?",08-133-06,133,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-133-11,"Right. So I remember, for instance, reading the January 25th Hendon Report and it talks about intelligence gaps for those three dates, 29th, 30th, or 31st -- the 28th to the 30th, right -- that I got the impression that what it was talking about was we donât really know much about what's going to happen on these dates, rather than that these are the only dates we can expect the event will last.

08-133-21,"Right. So when you're pointing to these dates in the intelligence reports, I'm asking if -- I'm asking for your opinion, since you're the expert in this area -- when they talk about an intelligence gap or let's say these three dates, 28 to the 30th, what do we understand from the intelligence gap? Is it that we donât really know much about what going on for these dates, or can we conclude from the fact that there's an intelligence gap for these dates that the event will not last beyond these three dates?",08-133-23,133,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (contâd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
08-134-02,"So I think in your question that you hit the crux of one of the challenges we faced, impression. So there was a lot of opportunity to have subjective interpretation on it. I think we've done a much better job as an intelligence community to come together and be more clear through conversations in terms of what we feel these different statements mean. For me, it's important, as we move ahead, that we -- you and I donât need to formulate an impression on what it is, that we actually have a clear common understanding of what - - how and what that intelligence means so that we can actually have a clear common understanding of how we're moving ahead with it. As I read those reports, my impression was that they were largely scaled to around a three-day event with the potential and possibility that there could be people, a small group of people stay longer than that.",08-134-04,134,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-134-19,"All right. Now, we also spoke earlier about planning and who might have had the experience to help the OPS at that time. But donât you agree that Superintendent Bernier actually had a great deal of experience that he could offer, but he wasnât really asked to assist at that time, the early -- during the early stages of the convoy events?",08-134-21,134,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (contâd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
08-134-26,"So again, thatâs going to be a -- that would be a question better suited for Deputy Chief Ferguson in terms of how Superintendent Bernier was utilized. It is my understanding is that he was -- he did play a role in early days and played an increasing role as the convoy went through, because as I recall, when we did -- when he was finally assigned as Event Commander and Incident Commander -- Major Incident Commander, my apologies -- he had to take some time off because he had been working so hard in his other responsibilities. I just donât recall what they are, so that would indicate to me that he was being utilized.",08-134-28,134,28,26,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

Now, I want to ask you about the impact of emergency declarations. So first of all, we know that the City declared emergency on the 6th. In your view, did that declaration of emergency have any impact on the way the police operated?",08-135-11,135,11,9,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. FRANK AU (contâd),MR. FRANK AU,frank au
08-135-18,"So did it have any direct -- the declaration of the emergency -- declaration of the state of emergency for Ottawa had no direct operational impact. But I do believe that it did, is it actually escalated the understanding or demonstrated the escalated understanding to the community that we understood -- the City understood the circumstances that we were in. We couldn't -- as the state of emergency is structured within the City, there are very few powers that would assist us in our police operations, because we didnât have any large procurement needs.",08-135-20,135,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-136-02,"I would say absolutely that -- and when I talk about the benefits of it, I talk about it from a unified command perspective, because I know that the EMCPA was mainly utilized around traffic and mainly utilized by our OPP partners as they developed their part of the -- as they developed the highway part of the plan, moving ahead.",08-136-04,136,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

08-136-11,"Yeah. I believe there's probably four key areas that benefitted us. The first one is around allowing us to streamline the swearing in of members coming in to the City from other provinces. It is -- it's a challenging, sometimes cumbersome process that has multiple stages to it, so the ability to not go through that process with many different checkpoints in it allowed us to more streamline and effectively create operational bodies with members coming in. Second area would be around tow trucks. So the tow trucks, real or perceived, was always a challenge for us. I do understand that in the planning, the integrated planning team had identified a number of tow trucks to come, but they hadnât yet begun. I think the Emergency Act took away any of those barriers. The third area would be around the financial investigations, mainly conducted by the RCMP. And for me, the main benefit that it provided to us was it created a very stable, solid, logistic -- a legal framework for us to be able to operate within to ultimately carry out our takedown. It allowed for us to very clearly articulate to our frontline officers what their powers were and what the legislative framework that those were based around so that they could understand what to do and how to execute it.",08-136-13,136,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

There was a lot of expertise built within our organization. Most of that expertise had been lost to retirement, but beyond that, we had a two-year -- we had a two- and-a-half-year window of pandemic where there was no major planning that was occurring.

08-144-07,"And then three, Egress: ""It is expected participants will leave the city at different times depending on their personal intents. The egress period could continue for an extended period and this stage will continually be assessed and reassessed to determine the appropriate supports that are required to manage."" Does that refresh your recollection that it was thought that it's a large group of people, they are not all going to go at the same time, they'll go over a period of time, and we will assess that as it unfolds?",08-144-09,144,9,7,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

Staff[ing] will be revised..."" This may be a typo there, but: ""...mid. Should the operational period be extended. Staffing plans would include resources in the following order;..."" And they are set out there. So there was, again, some thought given to the possibility that this event may be prolonged and additional staffing needs could arise.

08-145-15,"No, there was no -- well.

08-145-28,"Well, I don't think he asked. I think we identified between the Command Team that I would play that role, so that Superintendent Abrams would contact me, and then I would then have either -- try and resolve the issue or have conversations with Deputy Chief Ferguson.",08-145-30,145,30,28,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-146-05,"Right. At the time that the convoy participants began to enter the City of Ottawa, you believed, and fair to say that OPS Command believed that they were dealing with people who intended to protest lawfully?",08-146-07,146,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

08-146-09,That's correct.,08-146-11,146,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-146-10,"And that the resources that OPS had available to it would be adequate to meet the needs of the community to protect the community, and of course, to allow the protesters to protest safely. Is that fair?",08-146-12,146,12,10,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-146-14,That's correct.,08-146-16,146,16,14,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-146-15,"Now, the -- beyond the OPP and Superintendent Abrams, would I be right that there was no intelligence brought to your attention from any source that alerted you to the scope or the scale or the duration or the degree of disobedience and criminal behaviour that you experienced?",08-146-17,146,17,15,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

08-146-21,Absolutely.,08-146-23,146,23,21,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-146-22,"Now of course, the -- had any intelligence come to your attention in the days, even the few days prior to the convoy commencing, I think you told my friend, Mr. Au, you would have faced a significant challenge with the resources that the OPS had available?",08-146-24,146,24,22,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-146-27,"That's correct. And like I said this morning, and I would want to reiterate it, what we didn't see in any of the intelligence, what was never brought to our attention, was the actual activity that the protesters were going to become engaged in. All the way across Canada, through almost every policing jurisdiction in Canada, they were monitored, travelled with, and always lawful and always acting in pro social behaviour, so there was no indications to us about the activity that was going to happen.",08-146-29,146,29,27,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-147-08,"Right. The number of commercial vehicles, trucks in particular, that came to the city would have presented a significant challenge in terms of logistics as to where they could be diverted without cooperation from the operators. Is that fair?",08-147-10,147,10,8,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-147-13,So what I would -- and I've contemplated this. I believe that it would have taken the scale of operation that we would've had with the number of resources and the detailed planning to remove the protesters that we did over the weekend of the -- late February to divert them ---,08-147-15,147,15,13,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

08-147-19,Right.,08-147-21,147,21,19,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-147-20,"--- from coming into the area. So it would've been a massive undertaking, it would've been on scale with what we had to execute at the end of February.",08-147-22,147,22,20,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-147-24,"That's what I wondered. And you could provide the Commissioner with assistance in this respect. Put another way, had the protesters adopted the perspective and defiance, I'll use that word, that they demonstrated in refusing to leave when requested to do so in the -- towards the end of January, then the 1,800 plus, I suppose it was maybe closer to 1,900, service personnel would have been required to manage them prior to their arrival in the downtown core of Ottawa?",08-147-26,147,26,24,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-148-04,I would fully agree with that.,08-148-06,148,6,4,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-148-06,"And indeed, would you go further to say that some of the extraordinary powers that were used as - - available to be used as a tool would also have been required in the event that they resisted cooperating with direction or lawful orders?",08-148-08,148,8,6,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-148-11,"That's difficult to say because that's not a plan we ever contemplated. So we didn't actually get to the planning perspective of that, but it would've been a massive undertaking with massive planning requirements and massive resource requirements to undertake keeping them out of the downtown core.",08-148-13,148,13,11,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-148-17,"Fair to say that there was no time to have drawn the plans that you're talking about or to have made the resource requests of the OPP, RCMP, and other municipal police forces in the short time that you had available prior to the protest arrival in Ottawa?",08-148-19,148,19,17,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-148-22,"So I would say that there is probably -- there is always time to do planning. We would've been under tight restraints. It would've have been very challenging, and I don't believe we would've had the level of detail or specificity. I think the big challenge would've been trying to access resources without having the level of plans that we know we should have to be able to bring resources.",08-148-24,148,24,22,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-149-01,"Right. And one of the things the Commissioner has heard is that there is a -- perhaps a fair question about whether resource requests should proceed ahead of plans or plans should be in place before resource requests. In this case, do you agree that once the protesters arrived and you saw what you were dealing with, as you've described it, that the most urgent thing that this city required was resources?",08-149-03,149,3,1,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-149-08,"So I think there's a balance to that question. I think you absolutely need the plans to be able to drive the specific resourcing requests that you're going to have, the type of specific skills that you're going to require. But the other side of it is you also have a responsibility as a leader in an organisation to make other organisations aware that this request may or is coming, regardless of the specific skills you need. So I think it is actually a parallel track that you can travel down.",08-149-10,149,10,8,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-149-17,"And so in the case of Chief Sloly, you support the idea that he was making requests of his policing -- your and his policing partners for the, in this case 1,800 personnel, that were reasonably expected to be required to deal with the protesters?",08-149-19,149,19,17,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-149-22,"I think it was reasonable for Chief Sloly to place all of the other chiefs, and ultimately at the end of the day chiefs across Canada, on notice that we were going to need a large number of resources.",08-149-24,149,24,22,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-149-26,"And in terms of that, I appreciate you were present with others at a meeting where Chief Sloly requested the team to assemble the information that would allow that number to be known. Turned out to be 1,800. Do you accept that your team and the Ottawa Police Service made a good-faith effort to define the resources that were needed actually?",08-149-28,149,28,26,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-150-05,So absolutely. I think we made the best faith effort we could. What we lacked at that point was the detailed level of planning to actually indicate the type of resources we needed. So we were putting best efforts forward while we were building -- or starting to build plans that ultimately were taken over by the Integrated -- or developed by the Integrated Planning Team.,08-150-07,150,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-150-13,"Right. And the numbers and specific roles actually map on reasonably closely, donât they?",08-150-15,150,15,13,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-150-15,So I canât comment on that because I wasnât involved in that.,08-150-17,150,17,15,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-150-17,"Fair enough. Can I get your help on this? So far as you know from the meeting -- and Iâve seen your notes. There isnât a note of this, just to orient you to that. You didnât make any notes that Chief Sloly said give me a -- fix a number a then double it. Thatâs not the method that he chose to follow, is it?",08-150-19,150,19,17,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-150-24,I donât have a recollection of that.,08-150-26,150,26,24,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,INTERIM CHIEF STEVE BELL,interim chief steve bell
08-150-26,"Thank you. Now, so far as -- a couple of other things, if I can just again for the -- make sure I get this right. I understand the Ottawa Police Service or perhaps the City has an arrangement with the Government of Canada to provide policing services in and around the Parliamentary precinct that are beyond the Parliamentary Police Services and that there is an MOU or another arrangement that -- by which the Government of Canada pays the Ottawa Police Service the sum of $3 million for that -- for those policing services?",08-150-28,150,28,26,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-151-08,"So the Ottawa Police Service is the police of jurisdiction in the City of Ottawa, so short of security details that are done within the Parliamentary precinct, which the Parliamentary Protective Services is responsible for, so security primary response, the police is still the police of jurisdiction within that area and all of the City of Ottawa. So if thereâs a major incident, we will assist in response. If thereâs a criminal investigation, the Ottawa Police Service will be the ones that conduct that investigation. So as part of the responsibilities that we as the police of jurisdiction in the City of Ottawa undertake, which isnât just response in Parliamentary Protective Services, which is demonstrations that would impact us directly because weâre Canadaâs -- the nationâs capital. The need for us to be engaged with Embassies and have a different level of response or different level of training as it relates to diplomats in and around our area is something that weâve come to an agreement with the federal government to compensate us $3 million a year for extraneous costs such as Canada Day or other events.",08-151-10,151,10,8,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

08-152-05,"A couple of things about Incident Management Systems, IMS or ICS, Incident Command Systems, you mentioned that that was a process that is well understood and had been used in the City of Ottawa by the Ottawa Police Service.",08-152-07,152,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. TOM CURRY,MR. TOM CURRY,tom curry
08-152-10,"So the -- within the City of Ottawa, they would use the provincial standard of the Incident Management System. Policing traditionally uses the Incident Command System. There is also another gold, silver, bronze for major events that has been adopted by the RCMP and been utilized in some circumstances by the OPP. So there is a hodgepodge. There is a bunch of different doctrines. They basically fall down to -- they basically boil down to a very similar set of circumstances.

08-152-26,No. Itâs something that I believe is really important within every area to have those discussions with the Commander up and down to make sure that everyoneâs clear on where the decision-makingâs made. Itâs something that I believe is worth undertaking to make sure that we can create better lines between those and better understanding of the different areas.,08-152-28,152,28,26,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

08-153-05,"In this case, prior to this convoy protest, I understand that you, Chief Sloly, Acting Deputy Ferguson had functioned, I think you told us earlier, in the Incident Command System effectively; right?",08-153-07,153,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

08-153-14,"So what I -- what I would say is Chief Sloly was regularly involved in reviews and revisions on operational plans.

08-154-07,"Yes. So unprecedented circumstances, immense levels of stress, very clear expectations on outcomes. And all of those together did strain the ICS system and, actually, for me, identified that there needs to be much better clarity, at least within the Ottawa Police Service, around how that system manages.

Now, I understand that is a very difficult task for an intelligence-gathering group. This was an extremely fluid and dynamic situation and I truly believe the intelligence gatherers and collectors did an amazing job in building the system as it went along and refining it, up to and including putting a reliability index as we continued through and having numbers put into those reports as we got closer to the date.

Iâm Rob Kittredge acting for the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms at these hearings and I have just a few questions for you today. And to show my hand a little bit, theyâre all geared at, as you say, fleshing out and discussing the necessity of invoking the Emergencies Act. Iâd like to show with these questions that, under your leadership, the OPS was quite capable of clearing the protests even if the Federal Emergencies Act was never invoked. So as I understand your testimony today, you identified four ways in which the invocation of the Emergencies Act may have been helpful to police in clearing the protest. First, it streamlined the swearing-in of officers from other jurisdictions. Second, it made it easier to procure towing services. And third, it -- the power to freeze financial accounts may have led some protestors to leave Ottawa voluntarily.

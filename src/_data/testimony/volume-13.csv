""Chief - can't continue to compare Ottawa to Toronto. Also, we had a blind spot. Ottawa was not soft [or something] sold on civil disobedience."" I'm not sure what that word is. Commissioner Carrique says: ""Don't disagree with you."" And then says: ""Never any suggestion that the Toronto situation is like Ottawa, this situation was not caused by OPP."" If we could keep scrolling, please? The second bullet, you indicate to Commissioner Carrique, ""It sounds like Ottawa got caught off guard. We need a collective understanding of what we did good and bad. Want the message to be we didn't have the intel and couldn't prepare and have a message going forward."" And then underneath that, Superintendent Morris says, ""Hendon report not perfect. This type of activity is novel. April 2020 - saw messaging re vaccination talk against..."" We could continue, please, to the next page. Again, ""Jan[uary] 20/22 - first heard on the specific event...""

We underestimated and as we learned more we tried to collect the info[rmation] and work closely with OPS. - Don't know how Ottawa could have been prevented.

And for whatever combination of reasons, it wasn't available to my EA, and so a request went through to the Intelligence Directorate. And subsequent to that, for reasons I'm not fully aware of, it went over to Superintendent Morris.

On or around February 1st, I believe it was February 1st, but I stand to be corrected if there’s other documentation, I was advised by Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson that Insp. Lucas was tired, that he was involved in planning prior to the arrival of the convoys, had worked through the weekend under intense pressure, that Insp. Lucas needed time off, and that he was being replaced. I don’t recall whether or not she told me who he was being replaced by. But I accepted that. Then I was waiting for a briefing from S/Sgt. Mike Stoll on the Public Order Unit Plan that I requested on February 1st. Supt. Dunlop showed up on Thursday, February 3rd, on two separate occasions, presenting that plan, and that caused great confusion for me and it also meant that we couldn’t actually get the presentation. When finally we started talking about it again on February 5th, I was then told that Supt. Dunlop had been the Incident Commander.

13-082-25,"Two things -- thank you for your questions. Two things, and I may have been guilty of it myself in-Chief. The pejorative term, “The protesters, the convoy,” it’s not accurate. There were an amorphous group of individuals, collectives, convoys that, in totality, could be described as “The Protesters, the Occupiers,” but they were by no means unified in their mind or their intentions or their actions. Secondly, yes, I use the term, “Assaultive” in the broadest case possible, broadest way possible. It is my understanding that there was Criminal Code assaultive behavior by individuals in and around the protest areas of the city, but I can’t tell you that they were specifically a part of one convoy, or specifically a part of some group that had clearly established themselves as a major, if a dominant factor. But there was Criminal Code level assaultive, threatening behaviour that became the subject of criminal investigations.

I understand that the City put up the cement barricades, or whatever; they have a term for the type of barricade. But they put up cement barricades where the vehicles were parked, basically in the first few days, and that those barricades essentially would prevent any other vehicles from getting in to where they were parked on the roadways, or from leaving; is that fair?",13-084-18,84,18,16,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

I believe in the first weekend there was a combination of different types of barricade usage, including the use of City-owned vehicles at some locations.

And is it possible that this focus on, you know, public safety, maybe he's reflecting a change in your language over time, that perhaps you use words like minor and this is peaceful with him, intending what you've explained here today, so possibly his notes of that call reflect wordings or language that you were using at the time but now you've since explained, well, I wouldn't use that wording, and as it went on, I don't use that wording.",13-142-14,142,14,12,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

You were asked on Friday by my friend, Ms. Rodriguez for the Commission, whether the streets of Ottawa were more akin to a family fun festival or a tinderbox waiting to explode, and you'll recall, unless I'm mistaken, that you didn't hesitate in expressing the view that it was more akin to a tinderbox.

The overarching sense was a tinderbox, but there were clearly elements and areas where it was less so and elements and areas where it was far more so. I want to be careful about that. That I think there were some genuine people trying to do some genuine things, and there was a lot of disingenuous people doing very dangerous things.

13-171-17,"So length of time isn't the issue as much as it is the quantity of the people that would be staying. So it was clear to me in the week leading up that I was getting regular briefings from the Intelligence Threat Risk Assessment side of things that there will be a small group of people staying longer, but that we had experienced those things in the past, there were well-established contingency plans and removal plans that would go through stages of days, weeks, sometimes months, and that our partners in the NCR were well- versed in how to do that. So there was always a sense that there would be a longer portion to the weekend demonstration involving a smaller group of occupiers. What we did not have, and to this day I still have not been able to see, even in hindsight, is there will be a massive number of people who will remain behind for weeks if not months and they will be engaging in a wide range of social disorder and criminal assaultive type behaviours for that entire period.",13-171-19,171,19,17,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And would you agree, then and again, not asking you necessarily about the reasonableness yet at this point, but that had the trucks not been allowed to enter the core, it likely would have been more difficult for the protesters to have become as entrenched as they did?",13-172-09,172,9,7,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

13-172-15,"Again, yes, but no. Entering the core meaning entering Wellington Street and the immediate streets east and west of that. I have heard this even before the convoy events arrived, like, closing down our core, closing down our interprovincial bridges for any reason are hugely problematic and they create a range of public safety and community wellness issues. For example, I believe it was in the late spring of 2021 where there was a provincial order that related to the pandemic, that interprovincial bridges and access points be closed. There was very little, if any, material consultation with the Ottawa Police Service that of all the police of jurisdiction in Ontario had the biggest impact by that order, and it caused a significant staffing challenge. We did close the bridges to the letter in the first 24 hours, but the push- back was massive and immediate from the health care sector, from the business sector. Closing things anywhere in the downtown core, anything in the downtown core is going to cause a range of public safety, wellness and economic impacts on the city. The concept of closing the entire downtown core, I think you've heard from other witnesses, would probably use as many resources as it took for the public order operation.

So the assumption that if we had known, we could have locked down the downtown core, it would have still taken 7 to 10 days to get that many officers in here to execute that plan, and then the impact on the City of Ottawa and the greater Ottawa Gatineau area might have been greater than the public safety problem we were trying to prevent in the first instance.",13-173-13,173,13,11,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And I could see just from mainstream media, and I believe I got a briefing later on from Commissioner Lucki that it wasn't successful. That literally within minutes, what looked like a well planned and well staffed exercise was frustrated and failed within minutes by a wide variety of countermeasures, whether they were planned and exercised before or they were just done in the spur of the moment. And my concern was that if that was on a two-lane highway in a very rural part of Canada, with no other buildings on the sides of the road and no density and no school zones or anything else, a much smaller footprint of vehicles and protesters and a proportionally much larger amount of available resources, if it failed so quickly, then any effort that we would do here would be extremely dangerous.

If you were to take an Alberta-type action, you would get a 10 percent lift in public opinion from Centertown residents because they're happy you took action, but you would take a 50 percent hit from residents in other parts of the city who were currently not expressing any concern with the situation. If things went south, like in Alberta, then they would blame the Ottawa Police for the misstep.

The level of effort that we would have to have, the scale would be, as I said, somewhere between the 700 range to the thousand-plus range to even begin to contemplate an operation that happened in Coutts. So I mean, I don’t want to say it was too little, too late. Whatever modelling was taking place here, it really was immaterial.

13-180-08,"Yes, and importantly to the point I think you were making -- and if I get it wrong, I'm sure you'll correct me -- but understanding, we brought in ASI to understand the budget implications. That’s the original contract of ASI was around the almost year-long budget debate that happened throughout 2021, in which case, the budget expectations and needs of a farmer out in the outskirts of Ottawa was as important as a condominium dweller or a business owner in downtown Ottawa. But in terms of to your point, the people that were most directly impacted, traumatized, victimized, were the people living immediately within the red zone or around the red zone. And so while it was somewhat interesting to know how people felt, more broadly, the victimization was happening in a micro location, and the risk was happening in a microdonation. Ninety-eight (98) percent, 99 percent of what we were dealing with was within 1 percent of the geography of the city. And so it was an interesting exercise. It didn’t prove fruitful, and the scale of the operation that ultimately was required made this a rather less than productive exercise.",13-180-10,180,10,8,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

13-181-09,"Absolutely, I can see why. And as I've said, Commissioner, to you and others, public trust is a direct equation to public safety, and what might look like a PR exercise to some is as rudimentary attempt as we could in the crisis that we were having to get a sense of where public trust lay. I could look at crime stats up and down, but I can tell you, you can actually have crime going the wrong way, and public trust going the right way. For instance, underreported sexual assault and domestic assault, when you can win public trust, what happens is that you get an immediate spike in reporting.",13-181-11,181,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

It's important to keep an eye on trust indicators as much as it is important to keep an eye on crime or victimization indicators. They are necessarily coupled. This was our best effort in the middle of a crisis to try to do some of that, but it was by no means a perfect effort.

No. I mean, I think legitimately, there would be within communities that were directly impacted and those that were literally within line of sight questioned a lot of things, again, without having background information or other context would question those things. I know that there were complaints coming in, and every one of those complaints that came to my attention were assigned to our Professional Standards Bureau for review, and any one of those reviews that showed misconduct were then assigned for proper investigation. During my time, I suspended one officer. I don't know what the status of that case is right now. So to any extent where there was a reasonableness to a complaint around not sympathy but actions that in any way undermine our ability to keep the city and the communities safe and bring about a successful, safe outcome, we took documented, formal, measured actions.",13-182-22,182,22,20,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

13-185-05,"So I was not aware of any complaint or internal matter in regards to that member. Just, I'll put that aside. But I think your question is important. Commissioner, I would just sort of engage you more directly, with your indulgence. But this has been something that I saw during my tenure as Chief of Police. It was something that I saw during my time in the private sector, and it is something with less clarity but in general, a trend, in regards to intelligence gathering, threat assessments at local, provincial, national, international levels. There is a bias, and I've spoken very publicly about systemic bias in policing, and not limited to systemic racism, in every aspect of humanity. I saw this during my time in Kosovo in peace keeping after 9/11 happened. There was a significant shift operationally, politically, socio-economically, geo-politically to the threat that was posed by the various terms around radical Islam and Islamic-based terrorism. When I was in private sector, I was invited by Public Safety Canada to be the Co-Chair of a committee of citizens from across the country looking at online radicalisation to violence and terrorism. And we received a briefing from CSIS, including senior RCMP officials, on the current state of the national threat assessment, and this would be the summer of 2019, 18 months before the arrival of the convoy. But this is also the time that we had the Incel van attack in Toronto. This is also the time that we had seen a rise of right-wing extremism, white supremacy, and violent events south of the border, and increasing levels of violence and recruitment north of the border. Presentation that we got on the national threat assessment had no mention whatsoever, zero, of right-wing extremism and white supremacy. So the question that was asked of me, is this a concern of mine, it was a concern of mine in my days with the Toronto Police Service, in peacekeeping missions, in private sector, on a Public Safety Canada committee, and as the Chief of Police here in Ottawa. I would validate that concern.",13-185-07,185,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. EMILIE TAMAN,MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
13-186-17,"And just a final question, then. I take it, then, that you would violently agree that in order to rebuild trust in policing institutions generally, but specifically here in Ottawa after the events of January and February of this year, that it will be important for the organisation to sort of confront those biases straight on and not be shy to recognise when its own members fall short by engaging in that kind of unfortunate analysis?",13-186-19,186,19,17,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

13-186-25,"First of all, I'm probably out of order here, but your line of questioning has been excellent, and how you're probing is helpful for me, I hope it'll be for the Commissioner. It's almost entirely the reason I was brought here, ma'am. That's why they recruited me. Because I have an outspoken track record over decades, not just when it was popular to do so, to confront racism and discrimination in any form in policing, a profession that I dearly love and devoted my life to. But one that I know, not because so much of individual factors, because we're just human beings, and we are incredibly imperfect, but incredibly imperfect human beings will build really imperfect systems, and those systems can have very bad impacts on communities, usually the most marginalised and racialized communities. And I have been outspoken on those matters, and I've dedicated the bulk of my leadership to addressing them. When I came to Ottawa, Commissioner, that's exactly why I was recruited to come here. That's the mandate I was given. And that I did that every day I held my office until the last day. And it is singularly the number one reason for the resistance to me, the undermining of me.

I was late coming onto the call. Minister's Mendocino and Blair were on the call. There were others. And sort of kind of waited in until things turned around towards me and then I recall there was an exchange between the two Ministers. Minister Mendocino indicated that he would leave the commentary to Minister Blair and then he proceeded to ask me two questions. The first question was whether or not we had considered using by-law enforcement to address some of the challenges that we were facing here. I thought it was an odd question, and so I said, ""Yes, we've actually issued hundreds if not thousands of by-law enforcement tickets, but that any level of enforcement was difficult, both in terms of the potential volatility of public safety impacts and the resource restrictions."" He then asked a second question as to whether or not we considered towing trucks or vehicles. And I said, ""Yes, we towed hundreds of vehicles and we'd actually towed some heavy trucks. But again, there's an extreme volatility around that type of enforcement action and that we had resource challenges with the tow trucks, particularly heavy trucks.""

We didn't -- I wasn't directed to, nor did I have a system where I had to reference Section 9 and call the Commissioner of the day from the OPP and then through that process find my way to the right resource.

So I'm going to be asking you about a few meetings that involved Commissioners Lucki and Carrique, as well as the Head of CSIS, Mr. Vigneault, as well as Deputy Minister Rob Stewart and Jody Thomas, who I believe was the National Security and Intelligence Advisor to the Prime Minister. Before we do that though, I just -- we're going to do that by looking at some other legal counsel's notes, the notes that we've looked at a number of times. But before we go there, I just wanted to get at some of your notes and ask you a few questions. And this is document OPS00014484, and we would be starting at page 20, please. These are, I think, notes you said you sometimes send yourself an email or make notes through Outlook or your email program about things that are going on.

Okay, so this is, again, Ms. Huneault's notes, and this is looking at the February 3rd meeting in the evening with Mr. Kanellakos, Mr. Stewart, Kevin Maloney, Commissioner Lucki, David Vigneault is at this meeting. I'm not sure what that middle name is, Press, I don't know if you know. That's fine. So I just want to... If we can scroll down just a little bit. So there is the Prime Minister's Office, you know, wants to open a line of communication here. I'll give you a moment to read right through this. I'm going to ask you about a particular part. There's a note: ""Understanding we've avoided the worst but now dealing with illegal protesters. We are risking public confidence to solve this problem. [Government] want[s] to be helpful but has limits. What can we do? If we were going to engage then who would we engage with?"" There's questions about by-law and the Highway Traffic Act enforcement. Can we scroll down a little bit more, please? Yeah, keep going. I know that -- so there's a bit -- something from Mr. Kanellakos. A little bit -- next page, please. Sorry. Okay. And then -- sorry, can you scroll down just a little bit more? So these are, I think, RS for First Minister Stewart, and he's asking about enforcement and what leverage do you have, and this is the note that your counsel has written: ""If you want an assessment of risk of this demonstration please frame the questions properly so you can get the info you need. Don't appreciate you suggesting I police differently based on colour."" And I think Mr. Stewart is saying that there's a reference that a minister said this: ""Your observation is very insulting to me."" And he's, I think, saying ""I hear you.""

13-230-14,"This was the first of the tri-level meetings that I had attended. I had been advised about their existence I think the day before from City Manager Kanellakos. He suggested that I participate in them, and I welcomed that invitation because it would allow me to be able to speak to all three levels at the same time, and ideally, to secure resources that we so desperately needed at that time. So I attended the meeting with great expectation and hope, quite frankly, that this would be a very productive and constructive environment and one that would accelerate the delivery of resources, not just police officers, but across the board support to something that we desperately needed here in Ottawa, and I think increasingly, the province and the country were dealing with. Coutts, Alberta was active, other locations across the country were active. I think by this time we knew there was something going to be happening in Queen's Park on the weekend. So I was looking forward to this. The section on the page above that you rolled -- you scrolled through was largely, I'll describe it as a monologue that Deputy Minister Stewart was providing to the group on the call. I wasn't familiar with most of the people on the call, so I was just quietly listening and sort of waiting for it to become more of a discussion. But there was a comment near the end of that that isn't captured by my general counsel, but it's what I reference on this page here. And this is not an exact quote because I don't have -- so I'm going off of memory and it's not captured in these notes. But essentially the comment was ""The Ottawa Police Service seems to be wanting to help a group of extremists and white supremacists to take over Ottawa, Wellington Street.""

Again, I won't speak for Mr. Vigneault, but I'm not suggesting there was a unified command, but he's talking about elements of a command structure there. He then goes into in point two to talk about how nimble they are, including the fact that it involves ex police officers. I forget if he talked about ex military or national security, but he certainly referenced officers. CIOPS is a term that I knew from my time in peacekeeping in Kosovo. And in point three, engaging and educating, my word educating, his word engaging Prime Minister and Ministers to better understand the dynamics of what's actually taking place here. And he used the example of the press conference, I believe that day, to give an example of the level of ability and capacity to use social media, use mainstream media for leadership that seems if not unified, cohesive, as examples of capability around his original term this is unprecedented.

13-263-20,"Thank you very much, sir. As I was reaching our resources I had to ensure, Commissioner, that we had utilized everything that we had available in good faith. I couldn’t ask for other police services to go down in capacity when we hadn’t exhausted everything that we had. To that effect, I think by he end of the first weekend we had extended shift schedules, increased our overtime pay. We then cancelled a COVID reserve platoon tht we kept in case a new wave of COVID wiped out a platoon, that we would be able to bring another in and not have any gaps. So we cancelled that and deployed those resources. That would be the Monday Tuesday after the first weekend. Shortly around that time we got into negotiations with the Ottawa Police Association. I don’t want to exclude the Ottawa Police Senior Officer Association because we probably needed to extend our senior officers and senior managers as well. That was assigned to CAO Blair Dunker to lead that. I believe towards the end of the first weekend to the second week, we achieved a successful negotiation with the OPA and that allowed us to change the shift schedule timing significantly and that brought additional hundreds of more officers into bare. We had already notified that we'd be cancelling elective leave, and I think at that point, we just cancelled everything. Around that point of the -- I'd say the end of the second weekend, I don't think we had anything in reserve, and at that point, we were only giving officers time off literally for health and safety reasons, and we've heard some examples around that. We already had officers working in excess of 2 weeks straight, 10, 12 hours a day, and it's been given in evidence, I've given it, most of this is during the coldest snap that Ottawa's had in over a decade, with average temperatures daytime minus 25 to 30 and nighttime minus 35. There was a frostbite warning for the majority of that. So these were all the efforts, and there's probably more that I can't recall off the top of my head, that we put in place leading up to the request for that additional 1,790 odd officers.",13-263-22,263,22,20,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

I would have no doubt either hosted or asked OPP Commissioner Carrique to host it or asked OPP Commissioner Carrique to host it or Commissioner of the RCMP if she felt other agencies from across the country should have been involved.

That’s a memory that won't leave me very quickly, because at that point, even without fully understanding the implications of that statement, I knew that our colleagues there had some four or five years of planning lead time and we were going to be really behind where they were to take on the G20 aspect in the City of Toronto, and driving straight back down to provide that information to the command team.",13-272-11,272,11,9,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

13-273-17,"I can't remember if I provided it in statement or in evidence in-chief, but throughout my tenure as chief, my performance evaluations by the HR committee of the Board were always outstanding. The one area that they wanted me to continue to try to push on was the Service's capability for corporate communications broadly, crisis communications specifically. While I explained that was a function of a lack of staffing and a lack of budget to fill staffing, our inability to recruit that type of quality communications into the organization, it was going to take far too long for us to build that capability organically through HR processes, and if they felt that we needed to make a leap, then we would have to procure those services. The Board was very much supportive of that, particularly going into the long budget battle that was 2021, and so I made a recommendation, I believe at a public Board meeting that the Board consider a procurement for a firm of Navigator's quality, and I was granted approval by the Board to pursue that with the condition that they would support both the Board and the Ottawa Police Service. Through the procurement process, Navigator was signed on. That was to help us with very high-risk, high- profile, controversial joint-Board service initiative to address workplace sexual harassment, workplace sexual violence and harassment in the Ottawa Police Service, systemic misogyny, to be clear. And Navigator was contracted to come in to support the Board and the Service around internal and external communications.

The next conversation I would have had was commissioner to commissioner, Carrique and Lucki, to what extent do the three of us believe that Navigator supports benefit us going forward in that unified organization chart that you showed, and if I had received significant negative feedback or a significant decision position from both of them that we discontinue, I would have taken that into serious consideration and likely ended the contract totally at that point.

FRANK AU,MR. FRANK AU,frank au
13-285-18,"Yes. A challenge that I found when I came into the organization. When I built the Incident Command Team at the Toronto Police Service, I identified that as a major risk. So as we're going back, Commissioner, this will be somewhere in the range of 2000 and -- late 2007, 2008. We would have multiple cycles on regular occasion in Toronto for major events, major incidents that would require an Incident Commander and potentially an Event or Major Incident level Commander on top of that. So when I started to build that as a Staff Superintendent for the Toronto Police Service, I built in three levels of redundancy, so that we could handle any three major events in the city at any time with full Incident Command Teams, full teams meaning an Incident Commander, an Operations Lead, a Planning Lead, a Logistics Lead at a minimum and then it could be built out from there, but we could have 3 stood up Incident Command Teams fully trained and capable, deployable within a 24-hour basis. It also meant that if we had one event, but it was protracted, it went longer than 12 hours or 24 hours, we would have a Plan B and a Plan C to come in place. Now I did not inherit that level of staffing or that level of funding when I came here as Chief of Police, but that is an optimal level. And the Ottawa Police Service at no point during my tenure was anywhere near that optimal level. Even with that, I encouraged our thinking around Incident Command and Critical Incident Command to go beyond the 12-hour cycle, because every now and then, something takes us past that point of human resilience where we see a significant decline of decision making and capability. We didn't have that ability going into these events. We were very stretched. We were already overwhelmed by the events of the explosion that we've talked about in Maryville, and so we were overstretched and overtired before we even got to the point of these convoy events unfolding on the weekend of January 29th.",13-285-20,285,20,18,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

13-287-01,"I didn't ask him that afternoon. I asked him both times when the meetings happened. I think the first meeting is around 10:30. I stand to be corrected. I asked during the meeting, ""Why is Superintendent Dunlop providing this briefing? I want to hear from Staff Sergeant Mike Stoll. I want to hear from Inspector Marand. Jamie, why are you providing this briefing?"" And he tried to give me some explanation. ""We've moved off of the Public Order Plan. We're going to talk about a neighbourhood policing strategy."" Again, I politely interrupted. ""That's not what this briefing is about. The briefing is about the Public Order options, the plan that I asked for on February 1st."" Literally after doing that two times, and not wanting to go to a third time, I said, ""Look, I think we're not in a constructive place here. Let's end this meeting. I would like another meeting before noon hour where I get Inspector Marand and Staff Sergeant Stoll giving me a briefing on the Public Order Plan with the three options."" I waited patiently for another hour and a half, and I think somewhere around 12 or 12:30, another briefing happened. Again, Superintendent Dunlop appeared on my Teams screen and started to present a discussion around neighbourhood policing in the neighbourhoods outside of the red zone. And I politely interrupted, ""That's not the briefing I'm looking for. Where is Staff Sergeant Mike Stoll?"" I was told he was in another room. I said, ""Well, let's wait. Somebody go get him. Bring him onto the screen or have him sign onto the Teams meeting. I need to hear from Staff Sergeant Mike Stoll."" Eventually, Staff Sergeant Mike Stoll was brought into the room and given a chair next to Superintendent Dunlop. I then asked Mike, ""What is the plan? What are the options?"" And he started to tell me that they hadn't got the resources they had requested on February 1st. He wasn't in a position to provide the briefing to me. I was extremely frustrated and disappointed, and I was confused because I still did not understand why Superintendent Dunlop was involved in this meeting, nor did Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson. I can't remember if Deputy Chief Bell was on either one of those calls, in fairness, but Deputy Chief Ferguson didn't explain to me at any point as to what the role of Superintendent Dunlop was and why we were not getting a presentation on the Public Order Plan and the three options. I only found out about Superintendent Dunlop on Saturday morning, February 5th, towards the end of that morning Incident Command briefing, where finally I said, ""Where's the Incident Commander?"" And I was told then by Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson that that was Superintendent Dunlop. I closed the meeting. I raised concern that I was not aware of it. I closed the meeting and then I asked for Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson and Deputy Chief Bell to see me in my office. It was at that point I finally had the disclosure from Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson that she had switched Superintendent Dunlop into the Incident Command. I felt -- I understood it was an Incident Command level, not an Event Commander level, and I understand there's some confusion around that. But the essential disclosure on February 5th was that Rheaume was no longer part of this. Lucas was at a lower level, and Superintendent Dunlop had been inserted into the significant decision-making operational level. That was the first time I heard of it. I counselled both for their respective roles, and I made sure that from there on in, in repeated meetings, that we would not have a repeat of that level of miscommunication. I never removed the decision-making authority from Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson. I always allow her to confer with whoever she needed to around these decisions, but I was very clear going forward, no more surprises like that.",13-287-03,287,3,1,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MR.

Again, just for context, sir, that was never a presentation to be a tactical briefing for Commanders to pull apart a plan and assess it; that actually took place later on in the evening. But Supt. Patterson wanted to present a sense to the Integrated Planning Team that we, having just heard the overall plan from Acting Deputy Chief Ferguson, comments from me, that this was a demonstration that as the operational lead, he had a sense of what the priorities were for the next 24 to 72 hours, and what the resources would be necessary for those types of priorities. It wasn’t intended to invite a detailed debate about the adequacy and effectiveness of those priorities and those plans. A debate did ensue, and probably in hindsight a healthy debate to have at that point of forming, storming, norming around a very new escalation and integration.

And no point ever more powder keg than that very first weekend. I had experienced it myself when I went on foot patrol at Wellington and Rideau and Sussex. I had experienced it myself. I had seen it and felt it firsthand. And those efforts of swarming officers, not just an individual officer writing a by-law offence, but sometimes officers in twos or threes or more were swarmed, senior experienced officers. We had brand-new recruits on the streets. This is a regular occurrence. Sometimes that serious injury or death is not the death or the injury to the officer. It's that an officer being swarmed and overwhelmed physically may need to resort to serious injury or death to prevent themselves from being overwhelmed. So it's a two-way issue. Not fear that the officer's going to get hurt, but the officer may hurt or take the life of someone who's trying to overwhelm them. And in every one of the incidences that I saw, or I even attempted as a uniform officer to gain compliance, even the most small compliance, was aggressively surrounded and intimidated. And if I had carried through on that or other officers carried it through on the most basic level of engagement, never mind enforcement, there was a risk of escalation to violence.

13-302-23,"Okay. So I'll take you to the Morden report, which we've seen before, COM00000616. And I just want to make sure that we're clear about the scope of the function of the Board, that it's not limited to getting resources, at least not according to the Morden Report. If we can go to page 22? So there it talks about three elements to the consultation protocol. So the first element is, ""Information exchange between the Board and the Chief of Police: [...] reciprocal information exchange [...] must exist..."" And I'm going to kind of condense it a little bit for time. ""...to ensure that each obtain information relevant to their respective roles. [...] the Board will be provided with operational information that will inform its policy-making function and the Chief of Police will have an opportunity to provide his or her views on policy options the Board is considering. With this exchange, both policies and operations may be adjusted to address changing circumstances."" And so the first step is exchange of information. Now the critical point is the second element, which, ""...seek[s] specific operational information from the Chief of Police where a ""critical point"" arises."" And now according to Morden, this is specific policing operations, such as a gun and gang operation, events such as, for example, a G20, or organizationally-significant issues. And so I would put to you that the events that happened in January and February of 2022 in the convoy was a critical point that the Board should have been involved with at an operational level. Would you agree that that's contemplated in Morden?",13-302-25,302,25,23,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,natalia rodriguez
13-304-05,"No, I wouldn't. And even with this information in front of me. I mean, if what Morden is considering -- first of all, Morden is a report. It is not a statutory authority with the Police Services Act, so it's informative but it's not instructive. Secondly, if what he refers to is a policing operation as a gun and gang operation, if that is, for instance, ""What is"", I go back to my Toronto Police days, but Toronto Police experienced, you know, sometimes years in a row of escalating guns and gang violence, ""What is, Chief, your approach to addressing gun and gang violence in the city? We'd like to have some policy positions on that. For instance, we are not going to use street checks and carding to disproportionately stigmatise or victimise Black and Brown populations in the city."" Check, Morden's right. If what Morden is considering is that, ""Chief, when you go to take down the Bloods and Crips, operating between 31 and 23 Division, you need to make sure that you have overwatch capability to make sure that none of our officers get hurt."" ""Sorry, you've crossed the line, you shouldn't be there."" I can't imagine in a thousand years that Morden would consider that the Board would sit down with the Chief of Police in the middle of the first weekend and start to debate policy instructions around a still unfolding national security event.",13-304-07,304,7,5,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MS.

In five months we had regular meetings, regular scheduled board meetings, specially scheduled board meetings, where Chief Blair and the Command Team, which I was a part of, provided a lot of information to the Board around what we were planning for. The Board had time to take tour of facilities were giving. We were able to give very detailed updates, even though we were on an incredibly tense timeline. And the Board could therefore on those occasions express policy matters.

So if I hear what you're saying correctly, you're telling me that the protests in Ottawa was not -- did not fall into any of these categories.

And we heard about that operational plan. I guess what I'm asking was, big picture, was the plan as you saw it at that time, that you would take bites out of the whole demonstration, starting with Rideau and then moving to other areas -- I think I saw reference to that -- and you would take chunks out of it?

And based on that current level of resources, February 8th, 9th, 10th, until we started to really see the numbers go up over the 12th, 13th, 14th, the best that we could envision operationally is taking chunks or bites out of the red zone, holding that, moving on to the next part, removing what was in there and holding that ground. If we were able to get the concept of predictable resources in the thousand, thousand-plus, the majority of which would be Public Order, we could conceive of an entire theatre of operations similar to the one that ultimately was deployed at the back end of the fourth week, the 17th, 18th, and 19th. But given the resource amounts that we currently had and could reasonably predict for 72 hours out, the best we could do was prioritize a list of locations and attempt each day to take one or more of those out, secure that area so people couldn't come back in, and move to the next highest priority, based on intelligence, based on the context of that 24-hour period, and based on the resources available in that 24-hours.",13-313-10,313,10,9,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MS.

That was the 2.0 version of it, it going into the second weekend. And then going into the meeting with the integrated planning unit, February 8th and 9, that became the 3.0 document. The concept of operations was -- I remember it being an eight-point concept -- I believe it was finally captured as a seven-point concept -- talked about things like a Public Order sub-plan that would take and hold the area. It talked about negotiations, it talked about officer -- member wellness and health and safety, a range of frameworks around which the overall operating plan was focused on. The take and hold component, the Public Order component that I was previously answering, I would say that would be a sub-plan that fed into the larger plan. It wasn’t the plan on its own that was -- that wasn’t, on its own, the take and hold, the overarching plan that we were inviting the integrated planning team to come in and assist with. It was our current attempt with the current resources we had to make a meaningful impact, safe and successful, but meaningful impact in the small way that our resources would allow us at this current time. I hope that clarifies things. But there is one overarching plan and several sub-plans. That sub-plan of take and hold was specifically explained to the integrated team at the February 9th meeting, and they challenged that sub-plan, I think constructively challenged that sub-plan, but they weren’t challenging the overarching plan, the framework of operations.",13-314-12,314,12,11,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MS.

13-315-18,"Because I'm just -- I'm still having some trouble understanding. If you have the take and hold, basically, and I think that was explained to the -- one of the documents to the tripartite group, I think, saying, ""Well, that allows us to move,"" and it included, I think, moving to Wellington. So I'm trying to understand, you need a big plan if you've got the bites that work. But maybe I'm misunderstanding.",13-315-19,315,19,18,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MS.

13-315-26,"But -- no, and sorry, it is hard to understand. That wouldn't be sustainable. We could -- with the resources stretched as we were, we were trying to take what we could in terms of Public Order plans. But if we didn’t get a significant, greater amount of resources, we would run out of steam very quickly. It's not a sustainable thing. And bite- sized across even the theatre that we had, that would take weeks if not months, and we just couldn't sustain our operations at that point without that massive extra amount of resources that the larger concept was requiring, the 1,800 or 1,790 change. So the concept of operations plan, the 3.0 plan was for a massive amount of resources to come in to do a significant amount of activities. While that was happening, we presented this sub-plan of existing resources to take and hold areas of the red zone. But that was not sustainable, and that would not have ultimately led to a safe, successful outcome. It's the best we could do at that time, and that’s what we were presenting.",13-315-27,315,27,26,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MS. NATALIA RODRIGUEZ,MR. PETER SLOLY,peter sloly
13-316-16,"Okay. So that may answer the question I was going to ask you. So your bite-size plan process, you weren’t asking or you weren’t complaining about the lack of additional resources by OPP and RCMP to fuel that sub- plan, you were focused on the big plan?",13-316-17,316,17,16,speaker_start,RE-EXAMINATION BY MS.

The Commission did its due diligence to ascertain whether he could testify with our without accommodation in these proceedings.

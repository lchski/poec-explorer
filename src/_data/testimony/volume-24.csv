Often they’ll have the presence of a CAF food inspector. And importantly, it's set up with our friends to the south in terms of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. They would have a similar processing capability to mirror the Canadians at those ports of entry. So for example, Coutts is the only designated port of entry that does commercial processing in the Province of Alberta, and the next available one would have been either in Saskatchewan or in British Columbia.

24-119-22,"So Transport Canada is responsible for all aspects of the Canadian transportation system that is within federal jurisdiction.

The first is to ensure the safety and security of the part of the national transportation system that’s in federal jurisdiction, ensure the environmental safety, environmental green performance, and then -- and to ensure the system is efficient, both for moving people and goods and so that there is a strong trade and transportation network. In terms of jurisdiction -- and it varies by mode, so in aviation, it's essentially exclusively federal jurisdiction, so Transport Canada is responsible for all aspects of aviation, working with international partners like the International Civil Aviation Organization. It is responsible for the vast majority of marine transportation, although there is some provincial involvement; the majority of rail transportation. Road transportation is very much a shared jurisdiction. Transport Canada is responsible for some aspects, but provincial governments are responsible for significant aspects as well, and we have significant federal/provincial/territorial governance to coordinate our efforts in that respect.",24-119-24,119,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,DM MICHAEL KEENAN,dm. michael keenan
24-120-18,"And I'm going to ask you to expand on exactly that last point that you mentioned, that road transportation -- which of course is, for a truckers' convoy, the more relevant aspect of your department's jurisdiction -- for road transportation, you have this divided jurisdiction where there are federal responsibilities but there are also provincial responsibilities. If you could just describe to some extent what that division is, and then I'll ask you to expand on how that prompts you to have interfaces with the provincial and territorial authorities.",24-120-20,120,20,18,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
24-121-01,"So in the area of road transportation, Transport Canada has responsibilities under two pieces of -- principally under two pieces of legislation; there are some others. We administer 74 Acts and 400 sets of regulations, but the two principle Acts involved here, the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, where we certify the importation and the use of motor vehicles as to their safety; and the Motor Vehicle Transport Act, where we have responsibilities and authorities with respect to international and interprovincial road transportation. Intra-provincial road transportation, i.e., within a province, is the -- is essentially the exclusive domain of the province except for the aspects that touch the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which is the safe -- the certifying that the equipment is safe. In practice, while we have, for example, international, interprovincial trucking, things like their safe practices, like, hours of service limits for truckers, in practice, that is federal. The interprovincial rules are federal jurisdiction, but for trucks that don’t travel interprovincially, they're provincial jurisdiction. We work together very closely at the two levels of government and there's a lot of coordination of all of the rules and the regulations and the policies with respect to commercial transport through the CCMTA, the Canadian Council for Motor Transport Administrators; and the Council of Deputy Ministers of Transport; and the Council of Ministers of Transport. Some of the federal rules, we delegate to provincial authorities to enforce, for example, the hours of service with respect to interprovincial trucking. And we work as much as possible to get an alignment between the provincial and the federal rules so there is as much as possible a consistent set of rules across Canada. Canada being a decentralized federation, there is some diversity in the rules across the country with respect to motor vehicle transport. The use, the licensing of the operators and the conduct and the operation of the vehicles on the roads is typically in provincial jurisdiction and most provinces have something like a Highways Act that where they set out the -- all of the rules and governs the regulations by which they oversee the use -- the transportation on the roads and highways, each province.",24-121-03,121,3,1,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

24-122-15,"Thank you for that. And now, if you could help us with the second half of what you were describing, which is as the result of that interplay between the federal jurisdiction over some aspects of transportation by motor vehicle and the jurisdiction of the provinces over other and territories over other aspects, you have quite a bit of intergovernmental connection at your level, and probably at the level of the people that work with you. But can you expand on that for us?",24-122-17,122,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
24-122-24,"I think that’s exactly it. For the reasons you stated, the effective transportation policy in Canada requires extensive intergovernmental coordination. And so it starts at the top of it, there's a council of Ministers of Transport and Road Safety. And then there's a Council of Deputy Ministers of Transport and Road Safety that I coach here with a rotating provincial partner. There is the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators. There is a group of Assistant Deputy Ministers, people that report to Deputy Ministers; the PPSC, the Policy, Planning, and Support Committee; and there are, I would guess, at any moment in time under PPSC and CCMTA -- and I apologize for the acronyms -- there are probably a dozen working groups of various experts working on some aspect of coordinating federal and provincial transportation policy.",24-122-26,122,26,24,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

24-123-20,"At Transport Canada, we began to -- we saw -- and sort of in the lead up to that weekend of the 22nd, 23rd, which was a full week before the trucks arrived in Ottawa, we began to see the reports of trucker convoys that was just beginning to show up on the screen. I think some folks in the department noticed something as far back as January 19th. I think that’s in our institutional report. It came to my attention around, I would say, the 22nd. And we were initially watching it because it was truckers, and so there was for two reasons. One is we have relationships with the commercial trucking industry. The second is that when you have convoys and the prospect of slow rolls, that has a potential to have an impact on the transportation and trade corridor system, a potentially negative one. So we began watching it about a bit more than a week before the trucks got to Ottawa. And then shortly after that, it began -- the interdepartmental monitoring and deliberations began through the deputy -- for example, the Deputy Minister's Operations Committee, DMOCC, of which I'm a standing member.",24-123-22,123,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

It's chaired by the National Security and Intelligence Advisor, the Prime Minister, and it has -- the security agencies are RCMP, CSEC, et cetera, as well as a number of departments that have responsibilities that connect directly to the safety and security of Canadians. Transport Canada is one of them. Our responsibilities in that respect are geared towards the transportation system, but we have significant responsibilities with both respect to safety and security. For example, a threat -- there’s -- there have been, unfortunately, in the past, terrorist and ideologically motivated extremists have targeted the transportation system. And so we have a mandate to ensure the system is safe from such attacks.",24-124-19,124,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,DM MICHAEL KEENAN,dm. michael keenan

The -- that started a few days before the DMOCC -- I think the first DMOCC meetings on this were early -- around the 24th or 25th. Around there. The one thing that came to our attention fairly early on is that the brand of a trucker convoy wasn’t really accurate. And in fact, when we talked to the professional trucking industry, the Canadian Trucking Alliance, the Private Motor Carriers Transport -- PMTC, I can’t remember, too many acronyms, focused on acronyms, -- they made it clear that this wasn’t them and this didn’t represent the professional trucking industry and pretty quickly started making public statements eventually -- initially distancing themselves from this activity, and then making it clear that they didn’t support it, and then finally, articulating how it was harming professional truckers.",24-125-21,125,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

24-126-13,"The first step was trying to understand what was happening and what was brewing, because as I think you may have heard from other witnesses, it was quite hard to get a fix on, because there was -- it was rapidly changing, it was dynamic, and quite unpredictable. So it would have been some initial discussion with industry partners to get a sense of what was going on and finding that point I raised, that it really wasn’t the industry, per say. Second was working with the -- in the structure of DMOCC and ADMNSOPs, working with our partners in public safety to understand what was -- what the collective assessment was of what’s going on. So that was a key aspect of the -- I would say the early activities leading up to the arrival of the movement in Ottawa. As things progressed, our roles evolved into probably about four different types of activities.",24-126-15,126,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,DM MICHAEL KEENAN,dm. michael keenan
24-127-02,Why don’t you list those now and we’ll go from there?,24-127-04,127,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
24-127-04,"Sure. So the first, I just covered. The second is that as the -- as we started to see blockades and occupations, we started analyzing what the potential impact was on eh trade and transportation system. And then that accumulated in, I would say, peak impact, once the Ambassador Bridge was closed for several days. The third is that when you start -- in the event of major events, protests, incidents, whatever, that requires a large and complex police response and crowds, Transport Canada will provide a certain sort of technical expertise and authorities in support of local law enforcement. And in this crisis, we did that in two ways. The first is that we -- because of our responsibility for aviation, we will close air space at the request of local police as they try to manage large events, riots, whatever the activity. Over the course of this crisis, I think we issued air space restrictions, they’re called NOTAMs, Notice to Airmen. So -- and we issued about -- we issued them in about a dozen cities across Canada. And we do that as a matter of course when the police of jurisdiction are seeking that in order to help them manage some major event or crisis. The other aspect of operational support is that we make our sort of -- we essentially make our authorities and our expertise available in support of police of local jurisdiction as required. And that will vary. In this incident, one very relevant authority and expertise we have is the transportation of dangerous goods. We have a significant directorate and we have significant responsibilities to ensure the safe transportation of dangerous goods in Canada. And I think around the 9th of February, the Ottawa Police Service, who was -- they were growing quite alarmed at the extent of propane being stored in unorthodox manners and the extent of the transportation of diesel and gasoline, and they sought some expert advice and support from Transport Canada. We had the same assessment, just watching from a distance. There was a lot of dangerous conduct with respect to explosive and flammable material, like propane and diesel. We provided two inspectors who did ride alongs with the Ottawa Police Service to give them technical advice as they were seeking to monitor and ensure the safety of the occupation in Ottawa. And over -- they were on scene with the OPS, I think for about three days, and supported the OPS in writing up probably about 20 sort of administrative monetary penalties for violations of the safe handling of essentially a lot of propane and diesel. So I think the fourth, it would be the -- after coming out of a meeting organized by my colleague, Deputy Minister Stewart of Public Safety with the City of Ottawa and the Ottawa Police Service, we were absolutely struck by the overwhelming challenges the Ottawa Police Service was facing on several areas. And that generated -- that led to some thinking of how we could be of assistance to our front-line police of jurisdiction. And from that, so in thinking about that, we ended up developing two strategies that we worked with a lot of partners on through the course of this national crisis. They became known -- the first became known as the Strategic Enforcement Strategy, and the second became known as the Tow Truck Strategy. And that would be, in sum, the four areas of work by Transport Canada with respect to the crisis.",24-127-06,127,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

24-129-10,"Maybe I could ask the Clerk to call up for us PB.CAN.00000860? Now to assist you, Mr. Keenan, I’ll draw your attention to the upper right-hand corner of this page where it says, “Working Draft February 13, 2022”. But we haven’t found a later draft, and I think that you’ve confirmed for us already that this is effectively the final version of this strategy.

24-129-19,And describe if you can what you were trying to accomplish with the strategic enforcement strategy.,24-129-21,129,21,19,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
24-129-22,"Sure. So the genesis of the strategy enforcement strategy came out of the February 3rd call between a few Deputy Ministers of Canada with the City of Ottawa, the Chief and a few senior officers of the Ottawa Police Service. And in -- it was an update on the situation in the NCR, was the purpose of it. When the Ottawa Police Service described the challenge they were facing, I think we were all struck -- I know I was personally struck by three things. The first is that the sheer scale of the -- and intensity of the unlawful activity was eclipsing their ability to manage, clearly. The second is that when they applied fines, they were issuing fines to the people blocking the street, and they were quite struck by they just ignored the fines, they threw them out, they laughed, whatever. So they were -- the deterrence effect from the fines that they were levying seemed to be very low. The third is that when they did try to -- when they did try to take -- when an officer tried to take an enforcement action, they would often be swarmed and then they would have to back down in what they described as in the interests of officer safety and public safety. And the fourth was that they were trying to build an operational plan to bring the occupation to an end, but one of the -- one of the impediments was they were unable to secure the heavy tow trucks they needed to move the commercial vehicles. And so we found that was a very sobering discussion. In coming back from that and reflecting on that, we had discussions inside Transport Canada, briefed Minister Alghabra, and he was obviously keen for us to do whatever we could do to help resolve the situation. And that because we’re a large organization with extensive regulatory responsibilities, we have a large oversight operation, compliance operation, enforcement operation, we have some expertise in compliance promotion and encouraging and strategies to encourage parties to comply with, well, usually transport regulations short of actual enforcement. And so we started developing two sets of things. One was a strategic enforcement strategy, and that’s the document you have here. The other’s a tow truck strategy. The idea here was to try and marshal every legal resources available and all of the best practices and strategies to try and convince people that, first of all, what they’re doing is illegal because there was some sense that a number of the people involved in the occupation did not have a clear understanding of how much illegal activity they were undertaking. Second, the consequences of it and how that is -- could be quite significant adverse consequences for them. Third, to -- thereby encouraging them, at least the ones that were open to any persuasion, to cease participating in the occupation and thereby so-called shrink the footprint. And so the -- given the fact that the initial attempt to levy fines, according to the Ottawa Police Service, had no effect, the thinking here was what if we looked at all available legal tools and had a comprehensive approach to deploying everything, municipal by-laws, Highway Traffic Act, Criminal Code, et cetera both in terms of as a communications exercise to encourage people to cease and desist the illegal activity and then, as necessary, using multi-pronged sort of options for enforcement. This product you see here, the February 13th final draft, was the -- was the ultimate product of that initial thinking on the part of Transport Canada, but it was refined through extensive discussions and consultations with our federal partners and with our provincial partners. It had -- it went to probably, I would say, call it 10 different federal-provincial discussions both with our provincial transport colleagues and with Public Safety’s provincial Solicitor-General Public Safety colleagues.",24-129-24,129,24,22,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

24-132-08,"Okay. We’re going to come back to the aspect of inter-provincial cooperation in developing this strategy. While we’re, though, describing the items you mentioned earlier in your list of points that Transport Canada mobilized to react to the situation, can you tell us about the tow truck policy or the approach that Transport Canada developed to the point you were describing about the need for heavy lift tow capacity?",24-132-10,132,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. GORDON CAMERON,MR. GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
24-132-16,"And so that was the second stream of thinking and strategizing that came out of the stark realization from the February 3rd meeting with Ottawa, and the - - we began exploring through a series of discussions both through the meetings convened by Deputy Minister Stewart with Ottawa and with our police and procurement colleagues at the federal level and with provincial colleagues. We began exploring options for solving -- what I would say solving the tow truck problem. What could be done in order to prevent -- to address the fact that the tow truck industry was declining to provide service to police in Ottawa, Coutts and multiple -- and in Windsor, everywhere? And so that ended up -- we ended up developing a six-part tow truck strategy. The initial focus was to work around, if you will, the inability to secure tow trucks by having a strategy of using -- first of all, using this, the strategic enforcement strategy, to try and convince the commercial drivers that’s in their best interests to stop, cease and desist, and leave the occupation or the blockade because if they voluntarily drive their truck home, we don’t have to tow it. The second is that if -- in the event that you can’t secure the tow trucks, the services of the industry, but police are ready for operations to bring the occupations and blockades to an end, to have strategies like as you -- as they enforce to get the keys and if they detain the driver because they’re breaking the law, have somebody who knows how to drive a truck drive it away to some secure location. A lot of the trucks were purposely disabled, and so then you’d have to have -- the next stage was to have mechanics get the truck in working order so it could be driven away and then a key part of the strategy is that, having maximized what you can do without tow truck services because they were blanket refusal, looking at a whole range of strategies to try and overcome the reluctance of the -- of this part of the tow truck industry -- and I should emphasize that because of the commercial vehicles involved, some locations you needed not just your average, everyday CAA small tow truck that shows up for a Honda Civic. You needed a large wrecker that had the mechanical capacity with an operator with the skill to safely move like a semi truck. And so we worked through a series of ideas that we kicked around with different partners to try and overcome the reluctance of the -- of that specialized heavy wrecker or heavy tow industry to provide service. Through the course of that, it became clear how deep we -- when we started this out around the 5th or 6th, we were optimistic we could find a solution. As we worked it and worked it and worked it, we got to the 13th, we were still -- a solution was still illusive. And what we came to realize over this period was essentially how deeply rooted the reluctance is from the industry and they -- quite frankly, it was quite clear what -- the picture that emerged to us was quite clear that they felt quite threatened and that -- that if they showed up and -- in support of a police operation on a convoy, they were putting their future business at risk, their property at risk and, to a significant extent, their safety at risk. And so while we thought we could figure out a financial instrument that would get them to show up, we didn’t - - we weren’t able to figure out a financial instrument strong enough to overcome those threats.",24-132-18,132,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And of course, you know, with what happened in the previous years, in terms of the rail blockade, for example, but also other events, you know, we develop expertise and knowledge about, you know, how to assess these different disruptions on the Canadian Transportation System, but also in the Canadian economy.",24-146-09,146,9,7,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,MR. CHRISTIAN DEA,christian dea
24-146-15,"And just in terms of understanding the impact on border blockades, the Commission understands from the Institutional Report that the nature of trade between Canada and the United States, I guess some of the features of the economy are an important background. Can you describe or provide some context on that?",24-146-17,146,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,stephen armstrong
24-146-21,"Yes. For any kind of economic impact assessment, we follow a very vigorous framework to make sure that we’re using the best data, but also that we validate that with industry. So we always start our analysis by having a good assessment of the context and what is happening. And in order to do that, we use the best data available. For example, in the context on the issue on the cross-border, we’re using Statistics Canada data to get a good sense in terms of the nature of the trades that are affected at different border points in terms of the magnitude, but also the type of the merchandise that were affected by the reduction or the blockade of the bridge. We’re also using other sorts of information, for example, information from CBSA about daily movement at the border, just to get a sense in terms of the fluidity and the capacity of the movement at the different borders. We were also using direct information and data from the industry to get a sense from them in terms of how they have been impacted and the impact for the operation overall. So based on this data, we’re getting a bit of a portrait of what is really happening. And following that, we always validate this information directly with industry. So I was having, or my colleagues or my group were having daily calls with the different sectors affected by the blockade on the borders, in order to validate, again, the data that we have, but also get a better insight from them about how they have been affected and what might be the implication for them in terms of production, in terms of issues for investment, for example, which was also a real threat for the auto sector, for example.

24-147-27,"Could I just ask, I guess, more specifically of the ports of entry that experienced blockades in February 2022, which were the most concerning from an economic perspective and why?",24-147-29,147,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,stephen armstrong
24-148-03,"Well when you look at the Ambassador Bridge, for example, this is a very significant, you know, I would say corridor to exchange basically merchandise between us and the United States. The magnitude is important. It represents, just by itself, about 26 percent of the value of the export that Canada is moving to the United States and 33 percent of the imports that Canada is making the U.S. is going through the Ambassador Bridge. So in terms of the strategic importance of this bridge, it was very, very clear. It’s clearly also very strategic in terms of the sector affected. In the south of Ontario, the auto sector, the manufacturing sector was clearly affected directly and quickly, because they are all now in adjusting time, you know, kind of a production schedule. So any delay, or reduction, or not accessing the equipment that they need in order to produce had a direct -- almost a direct impact ostensibly in terms of their activities. But there are other commodities that have been affected as well that are important for the Canadian communities, like, you know, the basic medical equipment, pharmaceutical equipment, as well furniture, food. So there is a lot of movement of merchandise through the bridge that clearly had a direct and simultaneous impact in terms of not only the manufacturing sector, but also the Canadian communities about accessing some of the goods that are important for them.",24-148-05,148,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,MR. CHRISTIAN DEA,christian dea
24-148-28,"Thanks. And I just wanted to pick up on a point I think that you were just getting into there, is that some of these goods that you were looking at is critical goods; correct? Or something that could be deemed critical goods. Can you explain to the Commissioner what are critical goods? What is the significance of that?",24-148-30,148,30,28,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,stephen armstrong
24-149-06,"Well there’s no official definition of the critical goods right now, but we can probably extract to and get an agreement saying that when it touches the health and the food security of community, for example, these are very critical to the day to day needs of the community and Canadians. And there is also another element of the critical aspect, when it’s also affecting the economic activities. And again, coming back to the manufacturer sector, not having access to the different equipment that was needed in order to produce had a direct impact on them in terms of their capacity to basically conduct their activities. So we have seen reduction and stoppage of the production in the auto sector and other sectors following, you know, the block at the Ambassador Bridge, for example.",24-149-08,149,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,MR. CHRISTIAN DEA,christian dea
24-149-21,"Right. But I just want to tie back to the critical goods for a second. I think you linked that to sort of the wellbeing -- the goods that are essential for wellbeing and health. Is it fair to say that if we’re looking at critical goods, that imports are more important than exports? Or are they equally important?",24-149-23,149,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,stephen armstrong
24-149-27,"You know, when you look at the composition of the imports and the exports, they are both very important. They are important for our colleagues in the U.S. as well, because we do export some of these critical goods as well, and not only for the community, but also to ensure that they can, on their side also, you know, produce what they need to produce in terms of sustaining the economic activities in the auto sector, for example. And the auto sector is a bit particular in the sense that the two economies are very integrated overall in terms of economic activity, but the auto sector is probably one of the most integrated. And the way they manage all the supply chain, it’s really integrated. It’s not a U.S. supply chain, it's not a Canadian supply chain. It’s an integrated North American supply chain. So any disruption in terms of the movement of what is needed on the supply chain is affecting, you know, both sides of the country very, very quickly on that.",24-149-29,149,29,27,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And I guess I’m going to ask about paragraph 89 here. You have some figures. So this is focusing on the Ambassador Bridge. And am I correct in understanding that, for example, where it says “agri-food” in the bullet, it’s 10.7 percent of all exports. Is that a percent of agri-food exports nationwide that are going through the Ambassador Bridge?",24-150-18,150,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,MR.

24-151-21,"Yes. Again, you know, it’s based on, first of all, getting good data and statistics from Stats Canada and other sources about the situation there. But again, data is not always reflecting what is really happening right now, so that’s why we have different, you know, engagements with the industry in order to get a sense in terms of how they have been affected by the different reductions of the movement at the border. And we have been in contact with -- here we have a short list of the key, you know, auto producer, but we have had a comprehensive engagement with also other sectors as well that were affected just to get a sense in terms of how the different sector were affected by the blockade of the -- at the border.",24-151-23,151,23,21,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

24-152-10,"Yeah. We implicitly take that into consideration because I was saying at the beginning, the first element is to get an assessment about the -- how the movement at the border’s affected, so we had a good understanding based on Statistics Canada about the magnitude of the export and the import and the value of that. And at the bridge, it was about 390, 93 million per day that are affected by the blockade there. And after that, we’re trying to translate that in terms of how much of these movements at the border will lead to a real issue in terms of economic cost and loss of economic activities. And in order to do that we’re using, well, what we think state of the art economic model in order to look at the impact of a reduction of the movement of the merchandise of the -- at the border and get a sense in terms of what are the sectors that will be the most affected and how they will be affected. And these models allow us to get a good picture, a good portrait of what happened on that side. And it’s with these models, again, validated with the industry, that we’re developing a kind of a net economic assessment of the impact of the blockade.",24-152-12,152,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

24-153-04,"I’d like to paragraph 92. It’s on the screen already. Here you address the food and beverage industry and it says that it appeared likely at the time that some manufacturers would have to shut down if the blockade persisted, which in turn could lead to less availability of food and beverage products and higher prices. Can -- do you know -- how did you come to the opinion that that appeared likely? What was the source of that?",24-153-06,153,6,4,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR. STEPHEN ARMSTRONG,MR.

It’s always more of a challenge to move perishable, you know, products during the winter so you have to work in a window that, you know, it’s already really more narrow. And after that, we had a good information that in terms of how much these industries on both sides of the border were affected. And of course, for them it’s real time. You know, if you’re not taking the fruits, vegetables, the flours, the other, you know, perishable goods and even if there’s a delay of one day or two, it means that they are losing basically some of the business or their business on that side. So they were very, very concerned about, you know, not having predictability on their side about when they can move their products and where. And again, even a delay in terms of the transportation on either side were not only adding costs, it was sometimes, you know, causing a problem of not being in a situation of delivering their products to their client.",24-153-15,153,15,13,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And depending of the region, on the -- I focus a lot on the manufacturing sector, giving the south of the Ontario challenges, but on the western side, their focus was more on, you know, live animal products, agrifood products, for example, or mining.

It was relatively straightforward to translate that through modelling and validation, in term of net economic cost for the different region. We have done the analysis for the Ambassador Bridge, for example, and we come with an estimate of the net economic cost. In term of the attribution of the overall other factor that is happening, that’s where it was getting difficult for us to assess the role of vaccination, COVID, global supply chain challenges, and/or challenges in term of, you know, shortages of workers due to COVID or other, you know, issues.

24-159-15,"Well, because, you know, for the reasons that I just mentioned; we were in a position, in the context of the blockade, to know exactly what was affected, in term of the traffic of the merchandise on the exportation and the importation. So that was -- it was clear about, you know, the sector affected, so we can use, basically, and we have used this information through our modelling to see how the Canadian economy and the regional economy and the sectoral economy were affected by the reduction, for example, of the traffic on the Ambassador Bridge. And that was a clear, you know, assessment of the impact of the reduction of the importation and the exportation at the Ambassador Bridge. So for this one it’s really clear. It’s when you’re trying after that to look and get, I would say, a kind of overall perspective about how the Canadian economic growth was affected for the different other shock, and how can you attribute, you know, the reduction of economic growth, for example, in a specific areas, then it’s getting more difficult to make sure that you can -- well, that you can do the causality or the attribution for the global shock versus domestic shock, health-related shock, or any other shock. But in the context of the Ambassador Bridge and the blockade on the crossing border, because we had information about the nature and the magnitude of the export and import affected, we were in a position to derive a net economic cost estimate.",24-159-17,159,17,15,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

24-160-25,"Yes. Again, the first key messages was basically to highlight the trade that was affected at the Ambassador Bridge; again, using Statistics Canada data that was available there. And we were in a position to highlight that about 390 million of trade daily were affected, which again represent 26 precent of the export of the country to the US, and 33 percent of the merchandise imported from the US by road. So we were looking at data now, and the next bullet, the next point was to say, “Okay, how this translate into economic loss in Canada?” In order to do so, we have used, you know, a modelling that we have right now in our group, and this model are state of the art model; they are giving you a snapshot based on Statistics Canada of the whole economic structure in Canada, giving you the detail by sector, so -- which allow us to look at, you know, not only at the macro level but at the very sectoral level and regional level, the nature of the impact of the reduction of the import and exported order.",24-160-27,160,27,25,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

24-161-16,"And when we do that we got -- we got an estimate of about 45 million of economic loss per day. But we were using -- giving, you know, that they are modelling tools, giving some uncertainty about how the different sector might have been affected at the beginning of the reduction of the activities. In order to bring a bit more certainty about the magnitude of the impact, we wanted the strategist to the right scenario. And the second bullet there present three different scenarios of all the reduction of the trade at the border impact the economy. The first one, assuming that the main factors affected will be transportation sector and the manufacturing sector, and more precisely, the auto sector. And again, this was informed partly by also the conversation we were having in -- with industry. And when you will look at, you know, this impact, the modelling is giving you an estimate of about 45 million of net economic loss, which means that the industry are producing less or stopping their production. It means that they are losing income and salaries. And this is less expenditure in the economy, less economic activities, and the 45 million there is capturing the direct impact of the reduction of the trade on the transportation and the auto sector. The other element were more to explore, you know, assuming that other sector might have been also affected by the reduction of the trade activities at the border. The 86 million refer to a scenario where it was not only the transportation and the auto sector; it was the full manufacturing sector in the south of Ontario that was affected, and then the estimate then rise from 45 million to 86 million a day. And the last one, which is more, kind of an extreme case for us, is to look at, okay, what is happening if all the sector are instantaneously affected by the reduction of the export and import at the border, and then you’re getting this estimate of 161 million.",24-161-18,161,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And through -- by redirecting some of their, you know, traffic, or their import and export from trucking to rail or other mode, for example, or they were in a position to have and sustain economic activities because they had some inventories to allow them to do so.

And we’re sharing a bit of their insight. On their side, they are using more -- it is my understanding that they are using more macroeconomic, you know, modelling tool to derive impact. And on our side, we’re using other set of tools that is giving us a lot more sectoral details about the nature of the shock and how the different sector are affected. So we always, in that regard, trying to collaborate, and collaborate effectively, to make sure that what were coming, in term of economic assessment, were consistent in the way to move forward. And if they were some question about, you know, some of the result from the different tools that we’re using, we’re trying to get a good assessment together about how can we explain the difference between the two. But in the context of the work with the Department of Finance, they have used our assumption about the trade impact or the shock in their model. And they were shocking the economy using their macroeconomic tool, and they got some result; and, on our side, we’re doing the same.

24-168-03,"Well, implicitly, you know, the short answer to your question is that the model is already capturing the potential substitution of the rerouting to a certain level. And this was already embedded in the modelling that we had have, because we can't see in term of how economy needs to be moved, and it was moved in the past. And all the past behaviour was captured that -- there in term of the way to get access to these element. And they have been shocked in the past as well. That was affected also some of the manufacturing sector that will giving us some benchmark about the dynamic element of the rerouting. What the model was not capturing though is the day-to-day change that we were seeing with some redirection of the traffic from Ambassador Bridge to the other bridge. And the model was not allowing us to capture also the cost associated with this rerouting, because rerouting doesn't mean that, you know, it's basically reducing the overall cost, the net economic impact. It might be a bit of a reduction associated to that, but there is also cost associated with rerouting about time, additional cost, loss of economic opportunities and we mentioned previously the perishable good, the food sector, where basically, you know, delay means for them that they are losing economic production and activity. So in order to fully capture that, we had to basically play a little bit more with the model or qualify a bit more the result of the model to see how we can take that into consideration.",24-168-05,168,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

24-169-05,"Christian, I think -- tell me if this is right that there's a number of real-world kind of challenges that some sectors had in diverting to other bridges that the model, for all its sophistication, couldn't fully capture. One of them is in the auto sector. It's a just in time system where sometimes a truck is really geared to make two round trips in a day. And then with this diversion, they can only make one round trip or half a round trip. And so that -- because it's so time sensitive and so synchronized, and that's one of many crossings, it's hard to have that in the model. The second is that one of the -- we came to this issue at Transport, which is the hours of service limit, because for safety reasons, truckers are limited on how many duty hours they can have before they have to stop and rest. And that their -- the trips under normal conditions are synchronized around the duty hour requirements. When they have a, like, a 4-hour diversion and a 10-hour wait, they kind of -- they time out and then they have to pull over for the safety rules. There was some discussion of a temporary waiver of those, which we do at occasion, so those kind of costs are material.

So that's why we're quite, you know, prudent with the scenario one. We're saying the sector that has been affected, it's mainly transportation sector and the auto sector. All the others, you know, were continuing basically to produce business as usual almost. And this is the attempt to try to capture that, to say that, you know, all the others will find ways to get access to their input, their equipment, to continue the production. So we did explicitly use these number, but the fact of restricting the shock to the transportation sector and the auto sector was more or less to capture these element that, you know, a lot of the other sector will be in a position to access, maybe not on a timely basis, but access what they need to continue to produce.",24-170-12,170,12,10,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

24-173-06,"Could I -- if it's helpful, could I add a point here because the -- first of all, in -- what you’re seeing is an exchange between Finance and the Department of Economic Analysis, which is very typical. I’ve been involved in that in three or four different departments. But there’s -- on this issue, I think there’s an important point around this issue of transient that I think is an important context. And this is a good discussion to put this impact in context. In one sense, there’s a transient and once the bridge opens, the shock wears off and the economy adjusts and gets back -- gets back going. There’s two aspects that are not transient. One is that there was some period -- and because the thing was closed for six days, it wasn’t that long, but there were a number of days and shifts where billion-dollar plants were idled and you don’t actually ever regain that. If you shut down a billion-dollar plant for a day, that’s a loss of production that you don’t actually ever truly get back. The -- but if you looked in paragraph 91 on the institutional report -- you don’t have to show it -- but it listed the impacts on the auto manufacturing plants in Ontario and it went through like Honda, GM in Oshawa and these different places in Ontario. What it was -- what it didn’t say because it wasn’t a Canadian economic impact, is the same thing was happening in the U.S. and there were auto plants as far south as Kentucky that were disrupted because they couldn’t get the parts across the Ambassador Bridge they needed for their production. And that created an economic impact that was -- could have been quite devastating and permanent, and that is the loss of confidence that Canada’s a reliable trade partner. And that -- a loss of confidence that a production -- in U.S. boardrooms and U.S. state and national capitals that a production system that cut -- that went across the border wasn’t reliable and you should consolidate in the U.S. And so there was an immediate extremely high level of anxiety out of the boardrooms of the automakers. Out of Michigan, the Governor of Michigan -- calls were coming in from Washington. I was getting calls from my counterpart immediately, “What’s up? Can we help?”. And because there had been a significant disruption two years ago with rail blockades, there was a growing -- we were seeing a growing sense of that, a question as to whether Canada was a reliable trade partner and whether its - - these trade corridors would stay open. That’s really important because that affects investment decisions. And there was -- there was a high level of concern at Transport, at Finance and at GAC that this was having an adverse effect on investment decisions in boardrooms of U.S. companies and, in particular at the worst possible time because there were a number of major decisions pending on production mandates and investments in auto plants in Ontario. And they typically weigh competing locations. And this bridge outage, particularly if it’s extended, could actually tip the balance in Canada’s disfavour, and so billion dollar investments that would have otherwise happened in Ontario were going to happen in Ohio or Kentucky or Michigan. That was a -- I would say an extremely high level of concern, and that if this had gone on longer -- if it had restarted, the risk of that happening was quite high. In the end, I think the consensus was it was a near miss. While it was a problem and there was a lot of anxiety, we were still -- Canada was still able to land a number of billion-dollar investment decisions by automakers like Stel Lantos, Honda, GM in the following months. All made billion- dollar investment decisions in Ontario. If this had gone on longer, if it had been repeated, then any one of those could have been easily unwound because a big decision like that is not final until it’s final and boardrooms are always assessing those kind of risks. So that is a major, I would say, strategic economic risk that -- and represents economic harm to the country that comes in the future that is quite material to the national interest, but by the -- but as sophisticated as these models are, either the Transport one or the Finance one, there’s no way to -- there’s no way to include them in the models. So my assessment would be the economic cost is, say, different versions of around $50 million a day and potentially much higher if this disruption undermines and reverses some future investment decisions in Canada.",24-173-08,173,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And then -- so over that course of sort of 7th through to the 10th and into the weekend of the 12th and 13th, we were continuing to advance those strategies as -- essentially as the index Track 1 approach. Somewhere around the 10th to the -- and through into the 12th and 13th, we put our minds to options for increasing authorities under a Track 2 Emergencies Act approach and had produced a couple of background pieces where the experts in safety and security with the different -- and aviation, road, marine, et cetera, rail were explaining, well, what could we do with our existing authorities and where could there potentially be a new authority that might be helpful?

And so through that evening of the 10th and the 11th, we took that as a very welcomed development. It was clear that Ontario had executed a major pivot and had -- and that the February 8th letter to me saying, ""there's nothing we can do"" had been replaced with a decision to do something material and significant.

And again, this is a document that's received some attention already in the hearing.

And then if you -- you received that and considered it, and we'll now look at your response, Mr. Keenan. So Clerk, if you could scroll up again. Further, please, to Mr. Keenan's thoughts. Okay. Now, you have a number of points that you mention in here. It's a four-part answer, and because we've only got a little bit of time, perhaps you could just give it to us in bullet points, and then I'm going to ask you to talk in some detail about this.

GORDON CAMERON,gordon cameron
24-181-08,"And the context was -- of this was both the question from the deputy clerk as well as I think a public comment that the Ontario Minister of Transport had made I think the day before after the letter came that the problem at the Ambassador Bridge was a border crossing, it's federal jurisdiction, so were looking to the -- what -- for the federal government to solve it. And it was a combination of those two things that I think led to the deputy clerk's question. And so the four -- the key points are raised, because we had looked at this, and the first is that there is no in statute in law, as of today there is no trade corridor or federal authority. So that -- it's that simple. There is -- second of all, I think the second point is that there are -- there is legislation that governs and protects the point of the crossing, and the two of them are the Customs Act, the CBSA authorities under the Customs Act, and Transport administers the International Bridges and Tunnels Act. And so there was a lot -- there were suggestion we should go use this Act to solve that problem. And we looked at that, but the Act gives the Minister of Transport some very significant authorities, but the geographic scope of those authorities is the actual federal infrastructure itself. So if the protesters had set up in the middle of the bridge and were blockading from the middle of the bridge, then that Act would be of some potential use, but because they were on the... The third point is because they're on the city streets of Windsor, the -- these federal acts have no scope covering the city streets of Windsor. And that the remainder of it was making the point that Ontario sort of backed away, either on the basis that they think this can be left to the federal government and its jurisdiction. But we needed to make it clear that that doesn't work, and that if they -- the only feasible way that they have to do something and -- because the streets of Windsor are under the jurisdiction of the municipal authorities of Windsor and the provincial government. And if they really truly want us to solve this the only way to do that is to declare and emergency and ask us to intervene through our Emergencies Act. That would be a very provocative approach, and it may succeed in having Ontario come back to the table and start kind working using their authorities to solve the problem.",24-181-10,181,10,8,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

The second point you described to us as being there are authorities but they don't work in this context because they only cover the -- you're thinking of only cover the actual facility itself. And the third one intrigues the reader because you say: ""The Ontario Ministry of Transportation [continues] to suggest the feds have full authority to manage international crossing, but this purposefully confuses authorities between governments."" And I think this was your point here, that when Ontario says, ""they are your bridges so you can control the blockades"", you think Ontario, this is my expression not yours, Ontario is being cute because everybody knows the problem isn't in the centre of the bridge it's on provincial territory with provincial jurisdiction or municipal authority.

Going across the country, the level of unlawful behaviour energy is really high in a lot of places and there was an assessment that there’s enough energy that things are really very close to some significant violence. And so managing the energy and trying to bring it down and downscale is obviously a key objective. There were -- we are -- on the 13th, we are well into the discussion of the Emergencies Act, and the options, and sort of how and whether to use it. And there was a discussion about the implications of what we would gain, in terms of necessary tools to resolve the blockades and occupations, and whether the invoking the Act itself would add energy to the blockades and the options. And both Rob and I, in different ways, but we both made the point we had to be very mindful of the Emergency Act causing a bigger blockade than it’s trying to solve. This is -- it’s like at night, it’s an intense weekend, but this reflects us working through and grappling to understand, as quickly and as best we can, all the intended and unintended consequences of something as serious as invoking the Emergencies Act in order to provide the most rigorous analysis we can. If we -- to add one more point, if we hadn’t been looking at this kind of issue of unintended consequences, it would have almost been irresponsible, given how serious the decision to invoke the Act is.",24-185-19,185,19,17,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

And that confusion, imputed it was purposeful, but there’s a -- I would say my assessment is that there’s a gap in the laws of the land with respect to the tools available to government to secure strategic trade corridors, because you -- once you get -- once you step one meter off of a bridge, you go from a federal -- a broad federal toolset to municipal bylaws. And that bears attention. I think there’s a solution to that.

The federal government has to solve it. And so the provocative point was to go back to Ontario and say, ""No, it's in your jurisdiction. You have to use your authorities to solve this, or it can't get solved. If you're not going to use your authorities, we don't have any unless you hand it over to us, and the only way to do that is the Emergencies Act.""

24-196-22,"It depends on the nature of the power. And interestingly enough in this context I would say because there was an acute national crisis, with significant risk to safety and the economic security of the country, there was a real urgency. And I'll give you -- I -- I'll talk about the federal orders because I'm a bit more familiar with their implementation than the Ontario orders. So on the 15th, the proclamation of the emergency by the Government of Canada was the 14th, the regulations were issued on the 15th. On the same day the regulations are issued, Transport Canada assembled all of the key transportation operators in the country, and with their -- and brief -- and with our partners at Public Safety briefed them on -- in detail on these authorities, and -- because we remained significantly concerned about, you know, slow rolls at airports, blockades at railways. And on the 16th, there was a -- Transport Canada joined Public Safety senior officials in a detailed briefing of all provincial transportation -- all provincial transport officials, all provincial sol gen's, the -- all provincial police forces and the major city police forces, police services, excuse me, running them through in detail all of these orders. And so within 24 hours there was an extensive promulgation to all operating partners on the orders, and they were -- and some of them were being used as early as the 16th, 17th. So it was -- I would characterise that, done a lot of implementation of regulations, this is the fastest I've ever seen anything implemented.",24-196-24,196,24,22,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

So I think, and I know your colleague, Mr. Stewart, did tell us about the briefings, it sounds like there was quite a lot of them, to various stakeholders and to including media and things like that. Were you aware that Ontario may have been a little bit slower in terms of carrying out some of the powers that it had under its emergency order?

So Mr. Freeman, he was taken to a document where -- it's the suspension warnings that the Ministry of Transportation in Ontario is sending out to operators, saying that they might be -- their licences may be suspended if they don't stop engaging in unlawful behaviour under the emergency orders. So those are not sent out until the 17th of February. That -- is that timeline, is that something that you were aware of at the time? Did you know that there was this... I suppose what I'm getting at, and maybe I'll just come out and ask you. One of the questions for me is whether Ontario's orders might have been enough had they been given some time to work. Now, there's a question I think whether they weren't prepared to sort of engage in more serious enforcement until the federal government's emergency had been declared. That's a question only Ontario can answer, and we can't ask them.

And the second is that -- so I didn't have a sense they were slow walking them, and I think in terms of all of the problems that tools that were deployed for under the Emergencies Act, I'll focus myself to tow trucks because that's the one where I sort of had developed over three weeks some instantaneous expertise, and on that one I didn't see how the Ontario orders were going to solve that problem, even if given lots of time.",24-199-07,199,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

And so there, they did a summary of their findings, and it says “Blockades at border crossings”, and I’ll just read that to you and then I’ll put the question to you. So: “In late January and February 2022, some border crossings between Canada and the United States were blocked by protesters, preventing the normal flow of goods between the two countries. According to Statistics Canada data, when combined, Canada's highway border crossings at the Ambassador Bridge (Ontario), Coutts (Alberta), Emerson (Manitoba), and the Pacific Highway (British Columbia) represent more than one-third of Canada's trade activity by road. Road transport accounts for more than half of Canada's trade with the United States. In customs basis figures for February, trade activity by road transport at these border crossings fell 8.8% compared with February 2021, with the Ambassador Bridge and Coutts crossings posting the largest declines. However, increased trade activity was observed at other crossings near the ones that were blocked, partly offsetting the decline in traffic. Overall, the blocked border crossings appear to have had little impact on the aggregate values of Canadian imports and exports in February.” Do you agree with that statement?",24-211-03,211,3,1,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

24-229-21,"Yes. And I think everybody involved in the strategic enforcement strategy it was very clear in their mind that we are not making operational decisions here, we're building a strategic toolkit to allow police, in developing their operational plans, to have stronger operational plans.

24-232-07,"I'm not sure I'd agree with that because my sense, our sense, and again, I would defer to law enforcement experts on this, but our sense is that there gradually was a deployment of the strategic enforcement strategy in the big sites in Windsor and in Ottawa, and that clear communication of the fact that they were illegal activities and that they had significant consequences, whether they were the suspension of the CVORs or the freezing of the bank accounts, successfully shrunk the footprint. And according to law enforcement, so a lot of discussions with law enforcement during this crisis, the shrinking of the footprint was essential to the safe operation to return law and order to the streets. So I think it actually did work and it did help and it was integral, that would be my assessment.

I think there is a need for better plans that include all levels of government in those plans in advance.

And in the case of Ottawa, when they tried to respond, they were being obstructed. And so it was an attempt to communicate on a wide scale to everybody who was either participating in the illegal activity, or thinking about it, that it’s illegal, it has consequences, and to try and convince them to rethink their approach to, it’s a term I learned in the course of this crisis, to shrink the footprint of illegal activity to make it more feasible for the police to have a safe operation to return law and order.",24-262-07,262,7,5,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.

So they were saying basically that, you know, they have seen some rerouting, which was part of the assumption that we were using in trying to capture with the scenario one on our side.

This is not an activity of the trucking industry.” And they further -- the second thing that they -- they made that very clear repeatedly. The second thing is, as Ottawa got occupied, the -- I know specifically the Canadian Trucking Alliance and others said, A, “This is not us. If you’re a truck driver and you’re there, you’re not representing your industry.” And that they asked everybody to “Be peaceful and leave soon.” And then the third -- there was a third round that was very intense from the 8th to the 10th, and that was 12 trucking associations across the country, the cattlemen, the vehicle manufactures, the food manufacturers, a wide range of the tool and dye industry, with really strong appeal to the blockaders at Windsor to stop and to allow the bridge to open, and there was some fairly impassioned communication from the trucking industry saying, “You’re really hurting truckers. You’re killing their ability to earn a living. They’re stuck. You’re actually stopping truckers from doing what they want to do.” So it was sort of those three messages evolving over time.",24-276-27,276,27,25,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

24-278-05,"It did. I would say that at the beginning, it was a little slow going because of that initial response that has been described by Ontario. And there was a general, I would say, reluctance of provincial colleagues to jump to the front on this, because it was such an awful crisis. The problems were so messy and the intensity and the anger coming from the blockades and the occupations was a cause for pause.

24-279-10,"Yes. In fact, we were -- unfortunately, we were seeing a well-established pattern because the 12th and the 13th was the third weekend of blockades and occupations. And so there was both the weekly cycle of it getting bad on the weekend and then receding a bit on the weekdays to get worse on the weekend again. In addition to that, I think you could see a bit of an upward trend in the size of the problem. It was growing both in terms of the entrenchment in Ottawa, where the occupation was getting more entrenched and attitudes were hardening on both sides. But as we went into the weekend of the 12th and 13th, you could see a growing pattern of activity disruptions and problems across the country.

24-280-08,"Yes. Once we started to see the slow rolls sort of transition to blockades and occupations, and as the crisis dragged on, we became more and more concerned that the next step -- or the next shoe was going to drop, which was the next blockade would be a rail one, and then we would have both the border blockades and the rail blockades at the same time, which would dramatically escalate the economic harm to the country.",24-280-10,280,10,8,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS.

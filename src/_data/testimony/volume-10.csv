I was very appreciative that we had that Integrated Planning Cell with some very experienced plan writers to be able to create a document very quickly, but there needs to be an appreciation that, although the overall strategy’s going to be a heavy PLT negotiations and communication piece, we have to prepare right now and start putting all the pieces together for a Public Order action if that was not successful. So in this comment that I make that the overall execution piece is missing, it’s a fair statement and it’s not any criticism on Phil Lue or C/Supt. Carson Pardy just because we had just put this team together and there was a lot of discussions that need to take place between all the people at the table, whether it be investigations from an authority standpoint, public order to what they need and propose as possible action plans, what this PLT need to do in the meantime to hopefully negotiate and communicate them out of the area.

The first one is that Chief Pardy told us that the key issues dealt with through the day on the 14th related to the OPS’ need to have their lawyer approve the plan.

Things were happening within our own sides. And as well, you have to hopefully also appreciate that we’re coming out of the period where there was that insistence on chief and legal approval. Those terms were terms that we were trying to transition out of and change that framework. My full intent, and may not have been fully communicated to C/Supt. Pardy, which no one is to blame, that my reason for asking for legal advice is to get a set of eyes on that just to ensure that I'm not creating risk for the organisation. There were a few things going on that day, and in the days prior, between a state of emergency and Ottawa, a state of emergency and the Province of Ontario, as well as some negotiation and some agreements being made from politicians at the municipal level.

So understanding that we're transitioning and trying to do this reset, it's hard to turn the switch right away, and it was kind of trying to steer it away from that model.

And I had met the -- that team for a brief moment that morning, and were contemplating and making decisions to transition our Command Post at the Operational level to Leikin to be co-located with that integrated cell. There was a lot happening between the 13th and the 14th that was unexpected, challenging, and we were trying to manage. The one piece that we have to remember is that yes, there is the Integrated Planning Cell, that is one component that's supporting me. We have to remember that I have an Integrated Command Table that I have set up. So it is not being done in isolation, it's not one person that is proposing or brainstorming ideas. Yes, the decision lies with me as the Event Commander, but you know, on this particular day, there was the Mayor's agreement that had transpired, which was resulting in potential movement of vehicles. Specifically sticking to the point that you're asking for, given the fact that we were potentially going to be having areas that protesters were going to be clearing the vehicles and leaving, my Command Table had some conversations between myself, Inspector Springer, Public Order, Police Liaison, Investigations, Intelligence with regards to figuring out if they leave how do we keep those areas from being reoccupied again. So when we're talking about the positive action, is that we wanted to, if those areas were freed up, we just wanted to make sure that they weren't going to be reoccupied. That conversation, that brainstorming took place at that Integrated Command Table at the Operational level. That's an appropriate conversation to take place, given the situation that we were in. Fully utilising all the resources at hand, we had to come up with a egress plan for any of the vehicles that wanted to leave as a result of that agreement to ensure that it was safe and non-impeded to get those vehicles out of the downtown core. We as a group discussed that what do we do with those areas that either get thinned out to maybe down to a couple of vehicles, and how do we hold it. At the time, and based on the infancy of our group, we brainstormed that it would probably be a good idea to try and implement some strategies to hold those areas. That was communicated to Chief Superintendent Pardy and Superintendent Lue by phone, and I definitely sensed concern on their part. They voiced their opinion and I took that away. Once that call was completed, we actually somewhat put a pause on that given the advice, recommendations, food for thought. I do have to say that Chief Superintendent Pardy, regardless of perhaps his strong conviction of maybe this was not a good idea, he still reassured me that I had his full support and that full team support on the decision that I’m going to make, which was very reassuring.

10-034-10,"So essentially, if I could put into context, what I’m being informed at this point is that the Mayor is wanting to develop a letter to present to organizers to say if you leave -- and I think there was some concession to remaining on Wellington for a period, that if they were willing to leave that he would have a meeting with the organizers at a later date. This aligned with what was taking place in other parts of the province and the country at the provincial and the federal level where the public safety Ministers were offering to draft a letter to protest organizers to denounce their protest and to leave. And if they did so, that they would have a meeting at a later date with them. So that’s somewhat very much aligned which was happening on the provincial and national level. And based on the information I had on the 13th at this time, that -- and having that plan in place with wanting to reduce the footprint and have -- negotiating protestors out of the area, it aligned with our plan. It was potentially challenges that come along with this when you’re talking about political agreements with protestors, however, I can only control what I can control.

Chief Superintendent Pardy informed him that the federal Minister of Public Safety, Marco Mendicino, was willing to approve a designated exclusion zone in downtown Ottawa. Superintendent Bernier conducted a tabletop exercise with Ministry of Public Safety staff to indicate that the exclusion area would look like -- what the exclusion area would look like. After the meeting, he was informed that Minister Mendicino decided that it was unnecessary to designate downtown Ottawa as a protected place and that the Minister did not want to designate a specific area in case police changed their plan.” Does that accord with what you just described to us?",10-042-22,42,22,20,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

10-045-17,"So it was launched, as indicated by the plan, by the 15th. I have to explain somewhat a bit this plan, because we are under very -- a lot of duress and a lot of time constraints and a lot of moving parts. This was a massive undertaking; something that an operation this large would often take, perhaps a month plus to plan for. So we were having regular meetings of the Command table when it was the Integrated Command, when it transitioned to a Unified Command; we’re having meetings about this plan. We were meeting with the plan writer, Brad Taylor and Carson Pardy and their team, continually to be feeding them as we were evolving information from the Command table, from our subject matter experts on what we require. And that was evolving right up to Phase 2 of our plan. But it’s important to note that we were in agreement with the concept of operation, and we were in agreement that it was not realistic to actually have a completed, actual nice with-a-bow plan by the 15th. It was going to be evolving. But by the time that we got to the 17th night, that was what we pretty much were going to have to stick with as we went into Phase 2. So the maintenance period, as I mentioned earlier, involved stabilizing the operation; getting more resources in; allowing Ottawa Police officers to rest; enhance a communication and PLT strategy on the messaging. And the messaging was very clear; “It's time to go, it’s time to leave. No more talking here, it’s -- you have to leave. That’s the only options that you have here. It’s over.” And that messaging, during that stabilization period intensified to a set date where we’re determining that, if they have not left, we’re going to move on to an “Actions On” phase, which is now a more tactical Public Order, supported by tactical CBRNE, which I mentioned was Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosive Team, with a very enhanced arrest plan; transportation, processing, housing plan, with many intricacies that need to be thought of, whether it be children that were going to be involved, because we knew children were on scene at the protest. We were aware of potential risks in vehicles, whether it be from unknown devices. We were aware that we were -- going to maybe be faced with people who are going to barricade themselves in vehicles. So it’s quite a complex plan with many moving parts that we had to focus on those key pieces. And that was the “Actions On” piece where we had multiple presentations from the various experts from Public Order, where the unified command had to make a final decision on, this is what we’re going to go with, with the integrated between Public Order and tactical CBRNE, plus the support from the arrest. Once that -- and we were going to go until it stopped; until it was over, until it was fully cleared. And we didn’t know if that was going to be one, two, three, four days, but we had to have the resources in place to sustain a long duration of the Public Order operation. Once it was cleared, we moved into the Maintenance phase, which was we had to make sure that it stayed clear of protestors, allow for rehabilitation of the streets, inspection of the streets. And then once we were satisfied that the protestors were not returning, and that we can start demobilizing resources, that meant that Ottawa’s back to a state of normalcy.

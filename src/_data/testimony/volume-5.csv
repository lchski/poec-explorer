05-024-02,"So there was some conflict and I was being advised by some people that I needed to limit the number of meetings that we were calling because police resources were stretched thin and every time I called a meeting, it took a whole lot of police resources off the street and off the front- line, and that they needed to prepare for that time consuming endeavour, so we needed to package up questions that we had and filter them through the communications department of police to try and give as much flexibility to police to do their primary job, which was to try to shut down the occupation of our city. So I was trying to be respectful of that, but also, I was in touch with Chief Sloly a lot, I was communicating with Board Members and with Members of Council as they requested. But the Vice-Chair of our Board, Sandy Smallwood, who has been on the Board a lot longer than I had, and has connections across the country, one of the things that he was doing was speaking with other experts in the field of police governance and talking about what we needed to be doing as a Board. And Sandy and I were talking regularly about that because, you know, we’re finding our way in something -- I’d never been through something like this before and it was new to us. And we were very concerned. We were cognisant of the -- what happened in Toronto with the G20, very aware of the Morden report. I’ve read the Morden report again through that process and we didn't -- we wanted to make sure that we were doing things properly. And so, Mr. Smallwood was in touch professor Andy Graham at Queens University, he was in touch with Alok Mukherjee who had been the Chair of the Toronto Police Services Board, he was in touch with other experts across the country. And Sandy and I were talking frequently about this, and on the Saturday morning we had this conversation about the depth of questioning that we as a Board were doing, and I had decided at that point that I needed a lot more detail about what the resource requirement was. Because our -- the Board is an oversight body. It has very limited roles, but what we need -- our primary mandate is to ensure adequate and effective policing in the City of Ottawa, and I wasn't feeling comfortable that we could -- we were meeting that test. And so, I decided that I needed to call an emergency Board meeting on that Saturday, to put really a simple question to the Chief, and that was, what do you need? What will it take to end this occupation of our city? And that was the purpose, it was sort of the sole purpose of that meeting, to get to the heart of the resource issue and what it would take for us to restore peace to our city.",05-024-04,24,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

We were taking what we could get because we were in need of all of the help we could get at that point.

And I guess what I took it to mean is that, there wasn't a policing solution locally with OPS, and OPS is -- it's a city police service. It does community policing, and emergency response, and a lot of other things, and certainly it involves itself in large scale events, because we are the national capital and we have over time. But we hadn't seen something like this before. It was clearly different, had a different flavor. You know, the whole thing was not like anything anyone had seen in the city before, and I think it had become clear to Chief Sloly that we did not have the resources inside Ottawa police.

And we're probably going to talk about this later, but I didn't know that there were issues, you know, that the RCMP and the OPP had because nobody told me that. But I couldn't understand why the resources weren't coming, but in my mind we needed to enunciate exactly the resource requirement and what that was for, and what it would take. I mean, we'd had the Chief say publicly that there was perhaps no policing solution. I took it to mean we didn't have enough at Ottawa Police, so what did we need? What would it take? What did that look like to bring it to an end? And by Saturday, I was just -- I think I was just, you know, at my wit's end, honestly.

And I'm -- and I just -- trying to be rational about this and think we need to lay out exactly what we need, and we need to do it now. And I phoned Chief Sloly and I said, ""I'm going to call a special Board meeting and I'm going to ask you what it would take in terms of resource requirement to bring this thing to an end, and I want you to answer that question.""

I mean, I think Sylvia Jones actually dialed back. She said they had sent 1500 officers. They had done no such thing. And but she did actually walk that back later and said that's actually not correct.

05-083-22,"Yeah. So as I was describing to you a little while ago, you know, there was increasing anxiety in this community at all levels, and a lot of the concern was aimed at Chief Sloly. And you know, I told you I was doing wellness checks with him. I was, you know, checking to make sure he was okay, because he's a human being and he was under intense stress, and I felt that that was important to do. And I'd had a conversation with him the week previous and I had made some comment along the lines of, Chief Sloly, you know there's a lot of people in this city that want your head. And he sort of surprised me with the reply that he made. His reply was, well, cut me a check and I'll be out of here. And I didn't expect that, and that didn't know if it was kind of just in passing, if it was flip, it was just you know, frustration in the heat of the moment. I didn't know, I didn't really understand the context necessarily of that comment. But in the days after that, in the next week, there was a lot going on and one of the things that was going on, and you heard it inside of the testimony from the witnesses that came before me, is that members of council were considering a motion to ask Chief Sloly for his resignation in a public forum. I was very opposed to that, that one, it's not City Council’s job, and I know they were under intense pressure too, and they wanted to look like they were doing something, but they were not members of the Police Services Board. Chief Sloly was not their employee, and it was not their job. It was also in my mind, constructive dismissal to ask a public official like that, in heat of the crisis, for his resignation is tantamount in my mind to constructive dismissal. And you know, if I can take a moment to explain the sort of culture that exists at City Hall, the mayor has a group of counselors that are very supportive of his agenda, and generally speaking, will deliver to him any vote on any issue at anytime. And so -- and that's a reality. And I know that no motion of that magnitude would ever see its way onto the floor of council without the mayor’s consent. And so, when I got wind that this was being contemplated, I started asking the mayor's staff if this motion was coming, because I was very concerned about it. I didn't share it with Chief Sloly, I thought he had enough stress, frankly, and if it was never going to see the light of day on the council floor, I wasn't going to tell him about it because he didn't need that stress. But if it was going to see the light of day on the council floor, then I felt that I needed to let him know. So there was that happening, and then there was what I would describe as some sort of insurrection from within that was happening, and there was always some tension in the ranks with Chief Sloly, right from the beginning. The honeymoon for Chief Sloly in this town was short lived and there was always -- I never -- I don't think he ever felt -- maybe I shouldn't speak for him, he can speak for himself, but I don't think he ever really felt entirely supported by his senior command, or by the rank and file inside police. And so, in the midst of a big crisis like this it all comes to a head, that's what happens, crisis sort of beget crisis. And he -- I don't think he had enough support from within, and then I was contacted by, I believe his name was Steven Hoff, a producer at CBC, and he told me that there was a story coming out about Chief Sloly and his behavior inside police, and he offered to share with me the highlights of that story, and they were extremely damning. And they were also disturbing in that, I mean, we at Ottawa police, and the Board is the employer of Ottawa police, and you know, we've spent a lot of time on the issues around workplace sexual harassment violence, and you know, I really take seriously the notion of having a positive working environment. And so, this kind of -- these kinds of serious accusations against our Chief, I mean if I describe them to you in broad strokes it's like, he's yelling at people, and is sort of a tyrannical dictator, I mean that was -- I might be overstating it slightly, but not too much. I mean it was that kind of accusations that clearly came from within the service. And Chief Sloly had been intimating to me that there was infighting occurring inside Ottawa Police. I didn't ask him for a lot of detail on that, nor did he share a lot of detail. He did tell me the Deputy Chief Patricia Ferguson had gotten caught up with some of the wrong elements and that, and he had had to send her home for a number of days, which was in the middle of a crisis so obviously extremely worrisome. He had told me that the Incident Commander had changed more than once during this crisis, and so there was obviously this other problem that we had inside Ottawa police, probably not well known to the public. But inside Ottawa police there's a bit of an insurrection going on and there seems to be -- there seems to be an intent to use this crisis to undermine the Chief further. That was my assessment of what I saw in that situation. And that story, they gave me a heads up, CBC gave me a heads up that they were going to be breaking that story within hours. I believe that was the evening of the 14th, so I called Chief Sloly about 9:30 at night. I asked him -- I talked to him a little bit about the CBC story. I asked him if he was aware of it, which he was. And I just said to him, I said, ""Chief Sloly, last week when I spoke to you, you said if we cut you a cheque, that you would be out of here. And I just wanted to ask you if you meant that, or not, or if you wanted to stay."" And Chief Sloly said to me that, you know, that he's the Chief of Police. He's put his heart and soul into this operation. He's worked very hard. We're getting close to bringing this thing to an end. He had every intention of seeing it through to the end, and that he wasn't going anywhere. And I said, ""Okay, fine, Chief. I just wanted to check with you because, you know, it's going to be a little bit of a rough ride."" And I just left him with saying, ""If you sleep on it and change your mind, let me know."" And the next morning, I think it was about 8:30 in the morning, he called me, and he said, ""I want to leave.""",05-083-24,83,24,22,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION BY JEAN-SIMON SCHOENHOLZ, (cont’d)",MS.

05-092-21,"I had a conversation with the Mayor. I told him that the Board had come to a decision to hire a new chief, Matt Torigian, and that I would be signing a contract that afternoon. The Mayor expressed his concern, I think from a place of not fully understanding all of the internal issues that the Board was aware of, but nonetheless, he's the Mayor of the City and I provided that information in advance of the announcement to him, and out of respect for the Office of the Mayor of the City. And I said to the Mayor, “If you are telling me not to sign that contract, then I will go back to the Board.” But the Board decision had been made. Let’s be clear. The Board -- that was done. And I said, “If you are telling me not to sign the contract, I will go back to the Board.” But the Mayor stopped short of giving me that direction. So we proceeded. In the intervening time, I mean, the Mayor was on the telephone to my colleagues, who in turn were letting me know that he was asking them to unseat me as the Chair of the Board. And by the way, you also heard some testimony in the last couple of days that when I was asking about the council looking to constructively dismiss Chief Sloly, they were also looking to unseat me as Chair of the Board, and I was aware of that, asked them about it, and they said they didn’t know. But nothing comes before Council without the Mayor’s knowledge and consent. So it was pretty clear to me that that was the event that was unfolding. As soon as I left that room, the phone calls started to set up the votes to unseat me. And a member of the media, I recognize it’s hearsay, but it’s a member of the media that I held in high regard that told me that it was the Mayor’s Office that leaked the information about the hiring of Matt Torigian, and the problem with the leaking of that information was that it created, in my estimation, a false narrative about the hiring of a new chief. I mean, they were suggesting to the public that we had abandoned our own process, we didn’t go through, you know, the normal process. And this was a short-term hiring designed to shore up the senior command. We were flying with one wing in our senior command. Senior command normally has two deputies, a chief, and a CEO. We had hired a brand-new CEO, we had one of our deputies was suspended from the service, our chief had just resigned, we were bare bones senior command in the middle of our biggest crisis ever. And so there were a number of considerations that the Board had made in coming to the conclusion that it was in the best interest of the police service and our citizens to go outside. One was to shore up the senior command to get the resources. Frankly, one was to protect Deputy Chief Bell, because in my estimation at the time, anybody that was going to assume that role, if it didn’t come to a positive conclusion quickly, was probably going to, you know, take some of the criticism for it. And I would have expected that he would, in all probability, be a prime candidate to be our next chief and I didn’t want to damage Steve Bell through this process. And frankly, we were looking for depth of experience in these types of issues than we had internal to OPS at the time. And it was basically those three reasons that said, okay, we need to shore up our senior command, we need to get more help from the right people, and we need to protect Deputy Chief Bell. And it was for that reason that we thought hiring someone on an interim basis from outside the service made sense. And with all due respect to the Mayor, I do believe that the Board and the Chair of the Board were in a better position to make that calculation than was he.",05-092-23,92,23,21,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION BY JEAN-SIMON SCHOENHOLZ, (cont’d)",MS.

So it’s not a question of the Commission, it’s a question of the documentation coming in. I think it’s been generally explained why it was not produced, but I think that could be explored further. I do share, obviously the Commission shares, the concern about fairness. Fairness is fundamental to this process. So if there are fairness issues, I will entertain them. Whether that’s required or not at this stage, I don’t know. Nor do you, I gather, because you don’t have instructions. So what I’d suggest is that we explore a little further why this wasn’t produced so that the record is clear, at a minimum, and then once you get instructions, we’ll see where we go from there.",05-096-06,96,6,4,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION BY JEAN-SIMON SCHOENHOLZ, (cont’d)",COMMISSIONER ROULEAU,commissioner rouleau

And so effectively -- or off my devices. So I handed over my devices to the City to take whatever they wanted from any of this and then yesterday when I was listening to the Mayor’s testimony on this point -- because in my estimation it was quite inaccurate. I sent a message to my former assistant who is now on a leave of absence from my office, but I said did we -– did they get that document? And she said, no, because it was on my phone, not your phone. And so I had -- Mayor Watson is aware of the existence of this recording because I had shared it with the City’s Integrity Commissioner.

And it goes far beyond me. He had, for whatever reason, at the start of this term, decided to build more of a coalition approach to governing than he had in the past.

I think it was that there was a growing perspective in our community that police are responding to calls for crisis situations, like someone experiencing homelessness, or someone having an addictions crisis or a mental health crisis, and that that isn't always the right response. And there are growing cries in the community to set up a new system where if you called 9-1-1 you might be calling for a paramedic, you might be calling for fire, you might be calling for police, or you might be calling for a mental health worker. And -- so I think there are a lot of voices in the community, and including community health and resource centres that would like to see, you know, at least an opportunity to where, I mean, if you might be dispatching more than one. You might dispatch fire and police and a mental health worker. But right now, police are the responders because they take up that space, not because they're necessarily trained in crisis response of that nature, or not because they're necessarily the best response.

05-192-04,"Yes. Provincial Operations Intelligence Bureau is the Intelligence Directorate or Bureau for the Ontario Provincial Police, so responsible for our jurisdiction, and also under the Police Services Act for issues where we provided specialized investigative services. We have six sections within the Bureau. The first is Intelligence Operations Section, which has to do with organized crime, et cetera. The second is the Protective Services Section, which has to do with close body protection for protective persons in the Province of Ontario. The third is Covert Operations Section, which has to do, administratively, with policies and procedures in relation to covert operations, undercover operations, informant recruitment, agent recruitment and handling, and also the operational responsibility for that. The next section is the Criminal Intelligence Production Section, which is primarily the handling of metadata information and the translation of information into intelligence. And the last section is the Provincial Anti- Terrorism Section, which is a large-scale, joint-force operation which engages in intelligence operations, covertly and overtly, in relation to national security threats.

05-193-11,"Yes. You’ll have to cut me short probably. In 2019, early 2020, the OPP witnessed a significant amount of protest, dissent, some of which caused us reasonable grounds to suspect or believe that those issues would engage in criminal activity or illegal activity that would have a public safety impact. As a result of that, we created a collection plan and reached out to partners in law enforcement and in the intelligence community to create a cooperative collaborative approach to collect information on issues that related to that. The reasoning was many of these issues, I might say all of those issues, are larger than any specific jurisdiction. So we collected a collection plan -- sorry, we made a collection plan, we created business rules, and we formally reached out to multiple agencies in Ontario, law enforcement, intelligence, we went further than Ontario, engaging federal agencies such as the RCMP, many components within the RCMP, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Department of National Defence, and then other police services were added as we went along, because there was impacts. So for example, the Vancouver police Department, Sûreté du Québec, et cetera. The rational for Hendon was to deal with large scale protest matters that impacted public safety. Very specifically, we did look at reasonable grounds to suspect and believe, as a sort of precursor for our involvement. In a very practical way, at the beginning of 2020 and the end of 2019, there was activity going on that had to do under the umbrella of Shut Down Canada. There was activity that activists would engage in to have a negative impact on the Canadian economy and on the Canadian democratic system generally. As we moved towards February of 2020, one of the major points of consideration was rail blockades, rail shutdowns, which came to pass in Tyendinaga for approximately three weeks, emanating from events in British Columbia, specifically the Wet'suwet'en issues and dealing with gas pipelines, coastal gas link, et cetera. We began, at that time, to engage closely with all of our partners because there were main events, such as Tyendinaga, such as British Columbia, but there were also a proliferation of events. And as my colleague, Insp. Bowden, will say, and Provincial Liaison Team, it was impacting multiple jurisdictions. And so that is how we chose to approach it. As time evolved, we had several events in Caledonia, and in the McKenzie Meadows occupation, which were relevant to our duties, and also had impact for other police services. I believe at that time, we engaged approximately 30 entities. We had regular calls, we had regular dissemination of intelligence products, and we regularly collected information for that purpose. As the pandemic became more pronounced, or more prolonged, some of those public safety concerns or threat variants altered. By April of 2021, we noted the emergence of something that we referred to as the Patriot Movement. And we focused on this specifically because it presented different threat components. I will say this. We had concerns. There was very, very little criminal activity, there was illegal activity, and there were impacts that we were facing. So through the summer of 2021, we noted more and more of that activity. I will also say that other factors occurred, such as hate crime statistics that were published in August of 2021. As a result of that, we evolved our collection plan and collaborated with our partners to focus on what we considered to be the primary threats. Our findings, our intelligence, our assessed information, was produced to all of our partners in the form of the Hendon Strategic Intelligence Reports, and I believe that was going out at that time to about 32 agencies, and it was going out to approximately 200 individuals within those agencies.",05-193-13,193,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

What you note in white in the first column on the left is a teleconference, because that was regular as well. And then we evolved our dissemination. We had our main Hendon group. On January 21st of 2021, our Commissioner, Commissioner Carrique asked me to begin to disseminate that intelligence product to nine police services, the Chiefs of the nine police services, to ensure that they were aware. So that’s what you see in one column. The Hendon Group in the next column, where you see the highlight in yellow.

At this point in time, I mean January 21st, we had grown to approximately 300 participants. From the Ottawa Police Service, given that Hendon had evolved since 2020, there were multiple people on the distribution list for the documents, and that same list received a request to participate in a teleconference. We could not go through our entire list from Vancouver across Canada every time, so we only knew the people who identified as participating. I can say that the members from Ottawa that showed great consistency in their participation were Det/Cst. George Boris (Phonetic), Det/Cst. Steph Quinell (Phonetic), at other times, and I apologize, I’m not always aware of their rank, I believe it’s S/Sgt. Isabelle Lemieux. The superintendents participated at times.

The discussion about the possibility of a galvanized effort to illustrate to Ottawa some of the grievances and the possibilities of doing that via a convoy was often discussed and was often in the Hendon Reports. The events that were planned came to very little fruition, I would say, or minimal fruition.

And I do want to say this. This may appear to be anecdotal. I refer to Intelligence as being engaged in acquiring secrets or mysteries.

So in doing so, the information that we were collecting and the analysis that we were engaging in to produce the intelligence illustrated that yes, Ottawa would be the culmination of this, but there would be other factors along the way and across the country, and specifically in relation to specific infrastructure, like border crossings, and specifically in relation to what we refer to as the business of government, so Queen's Park and also obviously Parliament.

So that was something that was heavy on our minds at the time. We had no intelligence to indicate what the use of that heavy machinery would be, be it compressors, be it tractors, et cetera, apart from some in relation to snow clearing for the purposes of parking. So that was a key thing that we were trying to determine, because the inductive leap there is why bring the equipment if you have no intent to utilize it?",05-220-05,220,5,3,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

There was a motor-vehicle collision on the day before the event, and that had to do with somebody running into somebody who was in the freedom convoy, so it was conspicuous for the absolute lack of criminal activity. So we were concerned because when a plan meets a counterplan, we didn’t know what would transpire. We were also concerned, in large cities such as Ottawa, such as Toronto, protests attract a multitude of elements who may have absolutely nothing to do with the protest. There’s been a lot made of extremists, et cetera. That’s a difficult word for me because it doesn’t really have a definition in law and it’s very subjective.

And following that briefing, there’s parts of this that don’t involve me, so I believe D/Cst. Stephane Quesnel of the Ottawa Police Service sent an email to Insp. Barclay of the OPP and that email stipulated that Chief Sloly wished to have every Hendon report since its inception. And I was surprised by that request because the Ottawa Police Service did have every Hendon report since its inception, and Chief Sloly himself had received every Hendon report since January 1st of 2021. So for over a year. And so we were very, very engaged in a lot of operations and analysis and I didn’t want people to be looking for reports to disseminate for the course of what was almost two years at that point, when the police service already possessed them, and they weren’t relevant.

05-242-19,"I was asked by the OPP Commissioner Carrique to provide an intelligence overview. I have to say that on that day -- for Thursday and Friday -- I’m sorry, I’m going by memory -- the 10th and 11th, there were multiple priorities. So the Convoy protestors or the leadership of several segments, were planning to not move the entire protest, but to make a show of a protest in Toronto, and specifically at Queen’s Park. So I created, and my team created a separate collection plan and an operational plan to assist the Toronto Police Service. And it involved multiple entities -- I mean police services, because there were multiple rallying points and we were dispersing our intelligence personnel to go to the rallying points to collect the information to produce the intelligence for Toronto in real time in their Incident Command Centre/Major Event Centre et cetera. That protest was to have occurred and did occur on Saturday the 12th. So the meeting you’re referring to occurred after that. So I gave an intelligence overview of what was transpiring across the province. Obviously Toronto, the events in Toronto played a significant component -- or took up a significant component of that. Chief Sloly was not happy with the briefing or the presentation. He made his displeasure evident and articulated that he didn’t like comparisons between Toronto and Ottawa and then spoke about Hendon, basically about the Ontario Provincial Police not fulfilling their intelligence mandate to assist police services of jurisdiction and that he and his -- I don’t want to misspeak -- I’m going to say his team, but he referred to a scribe and he referred to a lawyer that were present, which surprised me, I never encountered that before in an intelligence briefing either -- had reviewed the Hendon reports and there was nothing -- I don’t know what his word was, so I don’t -- nothing of value nothing of significance or nothing that could have assisted them. So the meeting went -- I mean it was difficult.

05-244-06,"Well, I completely disagree. I’ll use the terms “inter and legere”, I believe we provided -- I believed that a discerning read of the intelligence products throughout the fall of 2021 and certainly from the 13th of January in 2022, and then with the tele- conferences where the Ottawa Police Service participated in, and the intelligence products that had been produced daily since that period of time leading to on this date, February 12th, said that there will be a significant event in Ottawa. It will begin on the 28th or 29th of January. It will incorporate large groups of motivated people who are protesting and these are their grievances. It will incorporate large use of commercial motor vehicles, tractor trailers. Their intention is to impede the business of government and to be in the downtown area. They used terminology like “gridlock”. We said there was no exit strategy and their demands could not be met and it would be significant and there would be other calls for resources because there would be other events. I believe -- I did say to him, there’s no golden key. Like sometimes when people look for a product, an intelligence product, it’s like a golden key that will answer absolutely everything. Intelligence is designed to inform decision- making. I believe that our information collected and our intelligence produced from our entire partnership, were instrumental in informing decision-making about what would occur. So I disagree. But I did say that in terms of his displeasure with what he referred to as a comparison of Toronto and Ottawa, one of the issues is, sometimes in planning people fail to appreciate an event that hasn’t occurred yet. I call it a deference of the important for the urgent. When Toronto acted, Toronto had the benefit of the experience in Ottawa to say, “Yeah, this is a big deal; this is really going to happen”. So -- and I agree with that, and I did also tell him that he and the Ottawa Police Service were faced with a difficult situation, 100 per cent, I totally agree with that.",05-244-08,244,8,6,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

If we can go to page six, there’s a bolded paragraph: “The situation in Ontario remains volatile. Protestors and their supports are unlikely to be significantly deterred by any invocation of the Emergencies Act. The potential for conflict or an act of violence is likely increasing as the Ottawa blockade continues.” Why did POIB conclude that the Act was unlikely to deter the protestors and actually that the violence was likely to increase?",05-245-18,245,18,16,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

I mean some people on one side of the coin call it a conspiracy theorist, there’s a conspiracy theory that they’re going to invoke the Emergencies Act. So when the Emergencies Act is invoked, it impacts the people who feel that way and it aggravates their perspective and creates more frustration. So the people who are engaged in the protest did not believe that the Emergencies Act should be invoked, did not believe government should have more powers and police should have more powers.

05-303-18,"Okay -- Deputy Commissioner Cox and you’re expressing -- you’re expressing here -- this is dated February 2nd so we’re in the midst of these events and you’re saying that your office: ""POIB, is increasingly receiving requests for information, intelligence, open-source scrapes, background checks, et cetera, on a wide array of societal actors. Many of these entities are social movements that have perspectives that divert from the mainstream. They may not be engaged in criminal activity, nor do we have grounds to believe or suspect that they are. These requests are emanating from many clients internal and external to the OPP at an escalating rate and with great urgency."" And you’re expressing some concerns here. And maybe we can scroll down. Can you explain the nature of your concerns about these requests for intelligence about various entities?

05-304-14,"Yeah, there seems to be a causal linkage in some people’s minds between certain things that are not illegal or criminal, they just may not be in line with, and a nexus to, somehow, and intelligence threat. I can give you an example. I have had instances where people have approached me professionally because there were bumper stickers that had to do with entities that they disagreed with, so therefore those people shouldn’t be police officers, or they shouldn’t be parked in policing -- sorry, parking lots. And I heard terminology, “That person is right-wing so…and then therefore an assumption.” I used to hear all that all the time about left-wing. And I was very concerned about it because I worked in Anti-Terrorism at the time of the 9/11 attacks and I saw what these kneejerk reactions do, where we get information from the public on any number of issues related to what they perceived to be threats from Wahabism, or Salafism, or Suni Extremism, and there always seems to be an overreach that comes with this politicization. And I’ve had many instances where I’ve been asked to go through these intelligence checks without the reasonable grounds to suspect or believe that there is a threat posed. There is merely the presence of something or someone that someone doesn’t like.",05-304-16,304,16,14,speaker_start,CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. CARA ZWIBEL,SUPT. PATRICK MORRIS,supt. patrick morris

But because somebody has -- and I’m just going to use an example -- a Trump sticker on their bumper, it’s not a requirement to put the powers of the State against that individual.

05-306-28,"Yes, there is a distinction. Yes, I agree with that; there is a distinction between. And I also premised that within where we, as an intelligence entity focus. We don’t focus on smaller acts of civil disobedience, i.e., a small business owner opening their business in contravention to the Reopening Ontario Act. That’s a matter for education from a detachment or a police service and a possible laying of a Provincial Offence Notice, et cetera, et cetera. But more broad issues and more significant issues of civil disobedience that present as public safety issues require our assessment and collection to determine the nature of the threat and the gravity of the threat.

05-024-02,"So there was some conflict and I was being advised by some people that I needed to limit the number of meetings that we were calling because police resources were stretched thin and every time I called a meeting, it took a whole lot of police resources off the street and off the front- line, and that they needed to prepare for that time consuming endeavour, so we needed to package up questions that we had and filter them through the communications department of police to try and give as much flexibility to police to do their primary job, which was to try to shut down the occupation of our city. So I was trying to be respectful of that, but also, I was in touch with Chief Sloly a lot, I was communicating with Board Members and with Members of Council as they requested. But the Vice-Chair of our Board, Sandy Smallwood, who has been on the Board a lot longer than I had, and has connections across the country, one of the things that he was doing was speaking with other experts in the field of police governance and talking about what we needed to be doing as a Board. And Sandy and I were talking regularly about that because, you know, we‚Äôre finding our way in something -- I‚Äôd never been through something like this before and it was new to us. And we were very concerned. We were cognisant of the -- what happened in Toronto with the G20, very aware of the Morden report. I‚Äôve read the Morden report again through that process and we didn't -- we wanted to make sure that we were doing things properly. And so, Mr. Smallwood was in touch professor Andy Graham at Queens University, he was in touch with Alok Mukherjee who had been the Chair of the Toronto Police Services Board, he was in touch with other experts across the country. And Sandy and I were talking frequently about this, and on the Saturday morning we had this conversation about the depth of questioning that we as a Board were doing, and I had decided at that point that I needed a lot more detail about what the resource requirement was. Because our -- the Board is an oversight body. It has very limited roles, but what we need -- our primary mandate is to ensure adequate and effective policing in the City of Ottawa, and I wasn't feeling comfortable that we could -- we were meeting that test. And so, I decided that I needed to call an emergency Board meeting on that Saturday, to put really a simple question to the Chief, and that was, what do you need? What will it take to end this occupation of our city? And that was the purpose, it was sort of the sole purpose of that meeting, to get to the heart of the resource issue and what it would take for us to restore peace to our city.",05-024-04,24,4,2,speaker_start,EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MR.

We were taking what we could get because we were in need of all of the help we could get at that point.

05-028-14,"Okay. He had made that comment and it sort of sent a ripple through the city and the downtown core, and a lot of observers of what was happening there, because it wasn‚Äôt entirely understood. But it was alarming that the Chief of Police is saying there may not be a policing solution to this situation. And I guess what I took it to mean is that, there wasn't a policing solution locally with OPS, and OPS is -- it's a city police service. It does community policing, and emergency response, and a lot of other things, and certainly it involves itself in large scale events, because we are the national capital and we have over time. But we hadn't seen something like this before. It was clearly different, had a different flavor. You know, the whole thing was not like anything anyone had seen in the city before, and I think it had become clear to Chief Sloly that we did not have the resources inside Ottawa police.

05-083-22,"Yeah. So as I was describing to you a little while ago, you know, there was increasing anxiety in this community at all levels, and a lot of the concern was aimed at Chief Sloly. And you know, I told you I was doing wellness checks with him. I was, you know, checking to make sure he was okay, because he's a human being and he was under intense stress, and I felt that that was important to do. And I'd had a conversation with him the week previous and I had made some comment along the lines of, Chief Sloly, you know there's a lot of people in this city that want your head. And he sort of surprised me with the reply that he made. His reply was, well, cut me a check and I'll be out of here. And I didn't expect that, and that didn't know if it was kind of just in passing, if it was flip, it was just you know, frustration in the heat of the moment. I didn't know, I didn't really understand the context necessarily of that comment. But in the days after that, in the next week, there was a lot going on and one of the things that was going on, and you heard it inside of the testimony from the witnesses that came before me, is that members of council were considering a motion to ask Chief Sloly for his resignation in a public forum. I was very opposed to that, that one, it's not City Council‚Äôs job, and I know they were under intense pressure too, and they wanted to look like they were doing something, but they were not members of the Police Services Board. Chief Sloly was not their employee, and it was not their job. It was also in my mind, constructive dismissal to ask a public official like that, in heat of the crisis, for his resignation is tantamount in my mind to constructive dismissal. And you know, if I can take a moment to explain the sort of culture that exists at City Hall, the mayor has a group of counselors that are very supportive of his agenda, and generally speaking, will deliver to him any vote on any issue at anytime. And so -- and that's a reality. And I know that no motion of that magnitude would ever see its way onto the floor of council without the mayor‚Äôs consent. And so, when I got wind that this was being contemplated, I started asking the mayor's staff if this motion was coming, because I was very concerned about it. I didn't share it with Chief Sloly, I thought he had enough stress, frankly, and if it was never going to see the light of day on the council floor, I wasn't going to tell him about it because he didn't need that stress. But if it was going to see the light of day on the council floor, then I felt that I needed to let him know. So there was that happening, and then there was what I would describe as some sort of insurrection from within that was happening, and there was always some tension in the ranks with Chief Sloly, right from the beginning. The honeymoon for Chief Sloly in this town was short lived and there was always -- I never -- I don't think he ever felt -- maybe I shouldn't speak for him, he can speak for himself, but I don't think he ever really felt entirely supported by his senior command, or by the rank and file inside police. And so, in the midst of a big crisis like this it all comes to a head, that's what happens, crisis sort of beget crisis. And he -- I don't think he had enough support from within, and then I was contacted by, I believe his name was Steven Hoff, a producer at CBC, and he told me that there was a story coming out about Chief Sloly and his behavior inside police, and he offered to share with me the highlights of that story, and they were extremely damning. And they were also disturbing in that, I mean, we at Ottawa police, and the Board is the employer of Ottawa police, and you know, we've spent a lot of time on the issues around workplace sexual harassment violence, and you know, I really take seriously the notion of having a positive working environment. And so, this kind of -- these kinds of serious accusations against our Chief, I mean if I describe them to you in broad strokes it's like, he's yelling at people, and is sort of a tyrannical dictator, I mean that was -- I might be overstating it slightly, but not too much. I mean it was that kind of accusations that clearly came from within the service. And Chief Sloly had been intimating to me that there was infighting occurring inside Ottawa Police. I didn't ask him for a lot of detail on that, nor did he share a lot of detail. He did tell me the Deputy Chief Patricia Ferguson had gotten caught up with some of the wrong elements and that, and he had had to send her home for a number of days, which was in the middle of a crisis so obviously extremely worrisome. He had told me that the Incident Commander had changed more than once during this crisis, and so there was obviously this other problem that we had inside Ottawa police, probably not well known to the public. But inside Ottawa police there's a bit of an insurrection going on and there seems to be -- there seems to be an intent to use this crisis to undermine the Chief further. That was my assessment of what I saw in that situation. And that story, they gave me a heads up, CBC gave me a heads up that they were going to be breaking that story within hours. I believe that was the evening of the 14th, so I called Chief Sloly about 9:30 at night. I asked him -- I talked to him a little bit about the CBC story. I asked him if he was aware of it, which he was. And I just said to him, I said, ""Chief Sloly, last week when I spoke to you, you said if we cut you a cheque, that you would be out of here. And I just wanted to ask you if you meant that, or not, or if you wanted to stay."" And Chief Sloly said to me that, you know, that he's the Chief of Police. He's put his heart and soul into this operation. He's worked very hard. We're getting close to bringing this thing to an end. He had every intention of seeing it through to the end, and that he wasn't going anywhere. And I said, ""Okay, fine, Chief. I just wanted to check with you because, you know, it's going to be a little bit of a rough ride."" And I just left him with saying, ""If you sleep on it and change your mind, let me know."" And the next morning, I think it was about 8:30 in the morning, he called me, and he said, ""I want to leave.""",05-083-24,83,24,22,speaker_start,"EXAMINATION BY JEAN-SIMON SCHOENHOLZ, (cont‚Äôd)",MS.

05-092-21,"I had a conversation with the Mayor. I told him that the Board had come to a decision to hire a new chief, Matt Torigian, and that I would be signing a contract that afternoon. The Mayor expressed his concern, I think from a place of not fully understanding all of the internal issues that the Board was aware of, but nonetheless, he's the Mayor of the City and I provided that information in advance of the announcement to him, and out of respect for the Office of the Mayor of the City. And I said to the Mayor, ‚ÄúIf you are telling me not to sign that contract, then I will go back to the Board.‚Äù But the Board decision had been made. Let‚Äôs be clear. The Board -- that was done. And I said, ‚ÄúIf you are telling me not to sign the contract, I will go back to the Board.‚Äù But the Mayor stopped short of giving me that direction. So we proceeded. In the intervening time, I mean, the Mayor was on the telephone to my colleagues, who in turn were letting me know that he was asking them to unseat me as the Chair of the Board. And by the way, you also heard some testimony in the last couple of days that when I was asking about the council looking to constructively dismiss Chief Sloly, they were also looking to unseat me as Chair of the Board, and I was aware of that, asked them about it, and they said they didn‚Äôt know. But nothing comes before Council without the Mayor‚Äôs knowledge and consent. So it was pretty clear to me that that was the event that was unfolding. As soon as I left that room, the phone calls started to set up the votes to unseat me. And a member of the media, I recognize it‚Äôs hearsay, but it‚Äôs a member of the media that I held in high regard that told me that it was the Mayor‚Äôs Office that leaked the information about the hiring of Matt Torigian, and the problem with the leaking of that information was that it created, in my estimation, a false narrative about the hiring of a new chief. I mean, they were suggesting to the public that we had abandoned our own process, we didn‚Äôt go through, you know, the normal process. And this was a short-term hiring designed to shore up the senior command. We were flying with one wing in our senior command. Senior command normally has two deputies, a chief, and a CEO. We had hired a brand-new CEO, we had one of our deputies was suspended from the service, our chief had just resigned, we were bare bones senior command in the middle of our biggest crisis ever. And so there were a number of considerations that the Board had made in coming to the conclusion that it was in the best interest of the police service and our citizens to go outside. One was to shore up the senior command to get the resources. Frankly, one was to protect Deputy Chief Bell, because in my estimation at the time, anybody that was going to assume that role, if it didn‚Äôt come to a positive conclusion quickly, was probably going to, you know, take some of the criticism for it. And I would have expected that he would, in all probability, be a prime candidate to be our next chief and I didn‚Äôt want to damage Steve Bell through this process. And frankly, we were looking for depth of experience in these types of issues than we had internal to OPS at the time.

The Ottawa Police Board disclosed a number of other documents. It was clearly something that they believed was relevant. It was not put to Mayor Watson yesterday. And I guess what I‚Äôm concerned about is the integrity of the process when we get these kinds of things 10 minutes before a witness is about to testify. I need to obtain instructions with respect to this. I have not been able to do so. And I guess what I worry about is what else is not being disclosed or what are we going to see after witnesses have already testified?

So I handed over my devices to the City to take whatever they wanted from any of this and then yesterday when I was listening to the Mayor‚Äôs testimony on this point -- because in my estimation it was quite inaccurate. I sent a message to my former assistant who is now on a leave of absence from my office, but I said did we -‚Äì did they get that document?

And there are growing cries in the community to set up a new system where if you called 9-1-1 you might be calling for a paramedic, you might be calling for fire, you might be calling for police, or you might be calling for a mental health worker. And -- so I think there are a lot of voices in the community, and including community health and resource centres that would like to see, you know, at least an opportunity to where, I mean, if you might be dispatching more than one. You might dispatch fire and police and a mental health worker. But right now, police are the responders because they take up that space, not because they're necessarily trained in crisis response of that nature, or not because they're necessarily the best response.

05-192-04,"Yes. Provincial Operations Intelligence Bureau is the Intelligence Directorate or Bureau for the Ontario Provincial Police, so responsible for our jurisdiction, and also under the Police Services Act for issues where we provided specialized investigative services. We have six sections within the Bureau. The first is Intelligence Operations Section, which has to do with organized crime, et cetera. The second is the Protective Services Section, which has to do with close body protection for protective persons in the Province of Ontario. The third is Covert Operations Section, which has to do, administratively, with policies and procedures in relation to covert operations, undercover operations, informant recruitment, agent recruitment and handling, and also the operational responsibility for that. The next section is the Criminal Intelligence Production Section, which is primarily the handling of metadata information and the translation of information into intelligence. And the last section is the Provincial Anti- Terrorism Section, which is a large-scale, joint-force operation which engages in intelligence operations, covertly and overtly, in relation to national security threats.

05-193-11,"Yes. You‚Äôll have to cut me short probably. In 2019, early 2020, the OPP witnessed a significant amount of protest, dissent, some of which caused us reasonable grounds to suspect or believe that those issues would engage in criminal activity or illegal activity that would have a public safety impact. As a result of that, we created a collection plan and reached out to partners in law enforcement and in the intelligence community to create a cooperative collaborative approach to collect information on issues that related to that. The reasoning was many of these issues, I might say all of those issues, are larger than any specific jurisdiction. So we collected a collection plan -- sorry, we made a collection plan, we created business rules, and we formally reached out to multiple agencies in Ontario, law enforcement, intelligence, we went further than Ontario, engaging federal agencies such as the RCMP, many components within the RCMP, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Department of National Defence, and then other police services were added as we went along, because there was impacts. So for example, the Vancouver police Department, S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec, et cetera. The rational for Hendon was to deal with large scale protest matters that impacted public safety. Very specifically, we did look at reasonable grounds to suspect and believe, as a sort of precursor for our involvement. In a very practical way, at the beginning of 2020 and the end of 2019, there was activity going on that had to do under the umbrella of Shut Down Canada. There was activity that activists would engage in to have a negative impact on the Canadian economy and on the Canadian democratic system generally. As we moved towards February of 2020, one of the major points of consideration was rail blockades, rail shutdowns, which came to pass in Tyendinaga for approximately three weeks, emanating from events in British Columbia, specifically the Wet'suwet'en issues and dealing with gas pipelines, coastal gas link, et cetera. We began, at that time, to engage closely with all of our partners because there were main events, such as Tyendinaga, such as British Columbia, but there were also a proliferation of events. And as my colleague, Insp. Bowden, will say, and Provincial Liaison Team, it was impacting multiple jurisdictions. And so that is how we chose to approach it. As time evolved, we had several events in Caledonia, and in the McKenzie Meadows occupation, which were relevant to our duties, and also had impact for other police services. I believe at that time, we engaged approximately 30 entities. We had regular calls, we had regular dissemination of intelligence products, and we regularly collected information for that purpose. As the pandemic became more pronounced, or more prolonged, some of those public safety concerns or threat variants altered. By April of 2021, we noted the emergence of something that we referred to as the Patriot Movement. And we focused on this specifically because it presented different threat components. I will say this. We had concerns. There was very, very little criminal activity, there was illegal activity, and there were impacts that we were facing. So through the summer of 2021, we noted more and more of that activity. I will also say that other factors occurred, such as hate crime statistics that were published in August of 2021. As a result of that, we evolved our collection plan and collaborated with our partners to focus on what we considered to be the primary threats. Our findings, our intelligence, our assessed information, was produced to all of our partners in the form of the Hendon Strategic Intelligence Reports, and I believe that was going out at that time to about 32 agencies, and it was going out to approximately 200 individuals within those agencies.",05-193-13,193,13,11,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR.

On January 21st of 2021, our Commissioner, Commissioner Carrique asked me to begin to disseminate that intelligence product to nine police services, the Chiefs of the nine police services, to ensure that they were aware. So that‚Äôs what you see in one column. The Hendon Group in the next column, where you see the highlight in yellow.

We could not go through our entire list from Vancouver across Canada every time, so we only knew the people who identified as participating.

So in doing so, the information that we were collecting and the analysis that we were engaging in to produce the intelligence illustrated that yes, Ottawa would be the culmination of this, but there would be other factors along the way and across the country, and specifically in relation to specific infrastructure, like border crossings, and specifically in relation to what we refer to as the business of government, so Queen's Park and also obviously Parliament.

The available information suggests that the blockade has ample moral, logistical and financial support to remain in place long-term.""

05-232-23,"Yeah, it's a great question, and it's one I anticipated, and it's one that on that day we had a great deal of discussion about. Why? We put in that there was a potential national security threat because of the movement to the borders, and specifically to the Ambassador Bridge. The apparent long-term capacity for the protesters to stay in place in Ottawa, the ongoing calls for actions elsewhere, the events in Coutts and the movement to the Ambassador Bridge and discussion of the tunnel. The Ambassador Bridge specifically because I believe it has the largest sort of exchange in terms of financial -- a dollar value in our country. So that is why we put that in in terms of a potential. I will say I spoke about that with colleagues from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and with the Integrative National Security Enforcement Team, and they did not see things that reached their threshold in terms of what would be deemed a threat to the security of Canada. So we were an anomaly in that regard, but we phrased that as a potential.",05-232-25,232,25,23,speaker_start,EXAMINATION IN-CHIEF BY MR. ERIC BROUSSEAU,SUPT. PATRICK MORRIS,supt. patrick morris

I have to say that on that day -- for Thursday and Friday -- I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm going by memory -- the 10th and 11th, there were multiple priorities. So the Convoy protestors or the leadership of several segments, were planning to not move the entire protest, but to make a show of a protest in Toronto, and specifically at Queen‚Äôs Park. So I created, and my team created a separate collection plan and an operational plan to assist the Toronto Police Service. And it involved multiple entities -- I mean police services, because there were multiple rallying points and we were dispersing our intelligence personnel to go to the rallying points to collect the information to produce the intelligence for Toronto in real time in their Incident Command Centre/Major Event Centre et cetera. That protest was to have occurred and did occur on Saturday the 12th. So the meeting you‚Äôre referring to occurred after that. So I gave an intelligence overview of what was transpiring across the province. Obviously Toronto, the events in Toronto played a significant component -- or took up a significant component of that. Chief Sloly was not happy with the briefing or the presentation. He made his displeasure evident and articulated that he didn‚Äôt like comparisons between Toronto and Ottawa and then spoke about Hendon, basically about the Ontario Provincial Police not fulfilling their intelligence mandate to assist police services of jurisdiction and that he and his -- I don‚Äôt want to misspeak -- I‚Äôm going to say his team, but he referred to a scribe and he referred to a lawyer that were present, which surprised me, I never encountered that before in an intelligence briefing either -- had reviewed the Hendon reports and there was nothing -- I don‚Äôt know what his word was, so I don‚Äôt -- nothing of value nothing of significance or nothing that could have assisted them.

05-244-06,"Well, I completely disagree. I‚Äôll use the terms ‚Äúinter and legere‚Äù, I believe we provided -- I believed that a discerning read of the intelligence products throughout the fall of 2021 and certainly from the 13th of January in 2022, and then with the tele- conferences where the Ottawa Police Service participated in, and the intelligence products that had been produced daily since that period of time leading to on this date, February 12th, said that there will be a significant event in Ottawa. It will begin on the 28th or 29th of January. It will incorporate large groups of motivated people who are protesting and these are their grievances. It will incorporate large use of commercial motor vehicles, tractor trailers. Their intention is to impede the business of government and to be in the downtown area. They used terminology like ‚Äúgridlock‚Äù. We said there was no exit strategy and their demands could not be met and it would be significant and there would be other calls for resources because there would be other events. I believe -- I did say to him, there‚Äôs no golden key. Like sometimes when people look for a product, an intelligence product, it‚Äôs like a golden key that will answer absolutely everything. Intelligence is designed to inform decision- making. I believe that our information collected and our intelligence produced from our entire partnership, were instrumental in informing decision-making about what would occur. So I disagree. But I did say that in terms of his displeasure with what he referred to as a comparison of Toronto and Ottawa, one of the issues is, sometimes in planning people fail to appreciate an event that hasn‚Äôt occurred yet. I call it a deference of the important for the urgent. When Toronto acted, Toronto had the benefit of the experience in Ottawa to say, ‚ÄúYeah, this is a big deal; this is really going to happen‚Äù.

05-252-26,"‚ÄúI should also mention there was a serious complication in relation to these activities. These individuals and entities are not, for the most part, participating in the realm of criminal activities.

05-254-16,"I think that they did impede the activity of government by virtue of their presence, and I think that led to significant discussion about the workings of Parliament and some security concerns.
